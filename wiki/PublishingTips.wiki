#summary Authoring and publishing tips for editors and publishers.

= Image Management =
Images can be managed in 2 ways: via the Media manager and/or via the Article editor.

Go to Site -> Media Manager

Then click on the folder "stories". Then create a new folder or browse into an appropriate folder to upload the image. 

Then to use the image in Article editor window, for example, go to Content -> Article Manager -> New

Then at the bottom of the textarea box you will see a button "Image". You can then browse to the appropriate folder where you uploaded the image to insert it in the body of the article.

Note, that through this page (Article editor) you can also upload images by clicking on the same "Image" button mentioned above.

One of the key difference between in-page image upload (Article editor) and Media Manager is, you can't create/delete folders through "Image" button in Article editor.

= Breaking News =

To create breaking news, start by creating a regular article.

Go to Content -> Article Manager -> New

  # Choose Section: Virtual
  # Choose Category: Breaking News
  # Keep the selection for radio button Frontpage: No

To have the image appear in the Breaking news box, include the following tags in the beginning and end of image tags, for example: <!--IMAGE images/stories/breaking_news/200811/sidr.jpg IMAGE-->
