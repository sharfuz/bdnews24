Security guards held and handed Faruq over to the police. <br /><br />Quoting Momena''s relatives in the initial development of the case, the police said the killing might have stemmed from her row with a publishing house. <br /><br />The Dhanmondi police chief had earlier told bdnews24.com that the police would investigate the alleged links of the publisher in the killing. <br /><br />Momena wrote a number of books including Hashi-Khushi, School Library Parjalochona: Prekkhit Bangladesh and Bhuture Gappo under the name of Momena Deyasini. <br /><br />Mamota, a seven-year-old domestic help, told reporters that Faruq, who had a good relationship with the family, came to the house at about 12.30pm and ate lunch. <br /><br />After lunch, Faruq was watching TV, and Momena was ready to go out, Mamota said. <br /><br />"Then I went to the kitchen and heard boroma crying for help. I rushed into her room and found Faruq holding her by the hair to kill her," Mamota alleged. <br /><br />"Faruq told me ''I''ll kill you too if you get near me''." <br /><br />Mamota then ran out of the apartment and broke the news to neighbours. <br /><br />Lift operator Abdul Alim told bdnews24.com that Mamota and another domestic help of a different flat went downstairs crying for help. <br /><br />Meantime, an unnamed person from a flat in the same building told Alim by intercom that a man had killed Momena and was trying to flee. <br /><br />Faruq hurried to the ground floor by elevator but Alim and other security guards stopped him as the gate opened. <br /><br />"I found him covered in blood," Alim said. <br /><br />Momena''s relatives said Faruq used to go to the apartment once in a while. Momena had helped him with money, they said. <br /><br />Major Ehsan Ahmed of RAB-2 who rushed to the scene told reporters that Momena had lived with her son Mainul Ahmed and Mamota in the apartment. <br /><br />Momena had also worked for Udyana School as a librarian. Her other son Saiful Ahmed lives in Russia. <br /><br />Momen''s husband Prof Sultan Ahmed died in 1994.', '', 1, 3, 0, 11, '2008-04-22 00:00:00', 62, '', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 0, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2008-04-22 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', '', 'show_title=\nlink_titles=\nshow_intro=\nshow_section=\nlink_section=\nshow_category=\nlink_category=\nshow_vote=\nshow_author=\nshow_create_date=\nshow_modify_date=\nshow_pdf_icon=\nshow_print_icon=\nshow_email_icon=\nlanguage=\nkeyref=\nreadmore=', 1, 0, 14, '', '', 0, 0, 'robots=\nauthor='),

(32, 'What will be shape of recovery?', 'what-will-be-shape-of-recovery', '', 'On Wall Street there is little doubt the U.S. economy is in recession, and analysts now are beginning to wonder, and worry, about the type of recovery that lies ahead. <br /><br />Often, a simple letter of the alphabet is used to describe a recovery''s shape. While economists are uncertain what the future may hold, few expect a sharp V-shaped recovery in which economic growth would bounce back quickly from a slump. <br /><br />"Certainly no one has projected a V-shaped recovery," said Bernard Baumohl, managing director of the Economic Outlook Group. "The nature of the problems that we are facing are very serious and as a result this is not some garden variety recession that we are having." <br /><br />Instead, analysts say a crumbling housing market, and persistent credit and liquidity problems in money markets, suggest the letters W, L or U are more likely to describe the shape of the path economic growth will likely follow. <br /><br />"We''re in recession right now and it''s going to last significantly longer and probably get a lot deeper," said Brian Fabbri, managing director of economic research at BNP Paribas. <br /><br />Fabbri warns that banks still need to unwind a lot of mortgage-related bets, which will likely keep credit conditions tight. "They are doing it in a recession and it''s exacerbating the recession," he said. <br /><br />RECESSION FIGHT <br /><br />The warnings come against a backdrop of aggressive efforts in Washington to keep the economy afloat. <br /><br />Since mid-September, the Federal Reserve has reduced its benchmark interest rate three full percentage points and policy-makers are expected to cut the Fed funds rate further at its meeting next week. <br /><br />In addition, the central bank has provided billions of dollars in liquid funds to near-frozen markets and stepped in to prevent what would have been an unprecedented collapse of the investment bank Bear Stearns, which some believed could have driven the economy into a 1930s style depression. <br /><br />Congress and the Bush administration also moved quickly to put in place an economic stimulus package that will put tax rebate checks in consumers hands to boost spending and likely will provide a boost to economic growth through at least the third quarter of 2008. <br /><br />These efforts should cushion the blow as banks sell off or write down mortgage related assets and a rising number of homeowners brace for foreclosure, but many economists think more will need to be done and some think a second stimulus package may be needed next year to assure a more certain recovery. <br /><br />"Clearly there is still risk in bank portfolios," said Fabbri. "Monetary policy has been diluted as we speak by tightening of credit lending standards." <br /><br />RECESSION? <br /><br />While Wall Street is convinced the economy entered recession late last year, the private-sector Business Cycle Dating Committee at the National Bureau of Economic Research, the accepted recession arbiter, has yet to make that call. <br /><br />But panel members have become increasingly gloomy. <br /><br />"With monthly GDP down sharply and three consecutive months of decline in payroll employment, there seems little doubt about a genuine decline (in economic activity), though nowhere near enough to call a recession soon," said Stanford University professor Robert Hall, who chairs the committee. <br /><br />So far this year the economy has shed a quarter of a million jobs, far less than the 1 million to 2 million typically lost in a downturn, although economists warn the toll will mount in the months ahead. <br /><br />"Things don''t look good. I know the unemployment rate doesn''t look that bad, but in my view that is because so many people have dropped out of the work force compared to the last cyclical peak in 2000," said Harvard University professor Jeffrey Frankel, another member of the NBER panel. <br /><br />"A W-shaped recession is certainly a possibility," he said, alluding to the chance of a double-dip recession. <br /><br />Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan, thinks the stimulus plan now in place will help bridge the economy to a point where the Fed''s interest rate reductions finally start making themselves felt. <br /><br />But even he doesn''t rule out the need for further action. <br /><br />"We may need another boost," Feroli said. "It''s getting better, but it''s getting better pretty slowly." <br /><br />Troubles in the housing and credit markets have already begun to spread more widely. <br /><br />On Tuesday, the nation''s largest health insurer, UnitedHealth Group, announced a lower-than-expected first quarter profit and slashed its outlook, saying a weak economy is causing customers to seek leaner benefits. <br /><br />"If you take consumers and housing out of the equation, you effectively set aside 80 percent of the economy and that tells you this is going to be a very weak and difficult environment," said Baumohl.', '', 1, 5, 0, 13, '2008-04-23 18:51:57', 62, '', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 0, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2008-04-23 18:51:57', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', '', 'show_title=\nlink_titles=\nshow_intro=\nshow_section=\nlink_section=\nshow_category=\nlink_category=\nshow_vote=\nshow_author=\nshow_create_date=\nshow_modify_date=\nshow_pdf_icon=\nshow_print_icon=\nshow_email_icon=\nlanguage=\nkeyref=\nreadmore=', 1, 0, 9, '', '', 0, 0, 'robots=\nauthor='),

Kamath, chief executive of ICICI Bank, India''s largest private bank, told a conference recently. <br /><br />"That is the catch-up time that we need to build various structures whether they are financial or whether they are real ... to provide the sort of momentum that we need." <br /><br />Formerly known as Bombay, Mumbai is a bustling port on India''s west coast. Home to 17 million people, it is already a base for two stock markets, their watchdog and the central bank. <br /><br />The city which overlooks the Arabian Sea is the face of old and new India: bullock carts toil alongside shiny sedans, shanties slope from walls near glazed offices, and sea vistas take your breath away with the low-tide stench of sewage. <br /><br />But India''s central government envisages a time when Mumbai will be a gleaming financial hub not too far removed from London, Dubai and Singapore. <br /><br />To this end it has appointed a panel to study ways of turning Mumbai into the sort of place where a high-rolling banker might want to live. <br /><br />Democratic government, a vast and growing economy, a large English-speaking workforce and a time zone overlapping Asia and Europe all work in the city''s favour, although markets need to be liberalised and the financial and legal system must improve. <br /><br />But financial reforms are nothing compared to the Herculean task of revamping Mumbai''s infrastructure and housing, an initiative that will probably cost tens of billions of dollars. <br /><br />HERCULEAN TASK <br /><br />With its pockets of faded British colonial grandeur, Mumbai is beset by infrastructure problems: debilitating traffic, a lack of housing, poor water delivery, with some homes served simply by water trucks, and an unreliable power system that results in routine power cuts in the suburbs. <br /><br />Even the geography of the city, a series of islands joined by reclamation, works against it. Space is at a premium and the city is getting increasingly cramped as an estimated 300 poor families arrive each day in search of work. <br /><br />The city''s infrastructure is rusty and overloaded. Six million people a day cram into -- or on top of -- its battered commuter trains. <br /><br />Efforts are underway to modernise the infrastructure, but observers say the massive sums of money involved are just a drop in the ocean. <br /><br />The Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai has budgeted 18 billion rupees ($450 million) to upgrade roads and bridges and 29 billion rupees to improve water supply this fiscal year. <br /><br />"Our journey on urban investment is just beginning," Ramesh Ramanathan, founder of the group Janaagraha, which pushes for civic reform, told a conference recently. <br /><br />"These numbers are insignificant ... compared to the true amount of money that will have to be invested in infrastructure over the next 15 to 20 years," he said. <br /><br />Officials are tackling some issues: corporation figures show 19 billion rupees allocated to widen century-old storm drains after about 1,000 people died in severe monsoon floods in 2005. <br /><br />Sanjay Ubale, secretary of special projects for the state of Maharashtra, of which Mumbai is the capital, says 250 new trains are on the way. <br /><br />Last year, a law that controlled urban land holdings was scrapped, potentially freeing large areas for development. <br /><br />High-rises increasingly dot the skyline and a second international airport is planned for the city''s outskirts. <br /><br />DEMOCRACY, BUREAUCRACY <br /><br />Further progress is hampered by miles of red tape and the housing shortage is not helped by a 1947 rent control act, that keeps rents for long-time tenants far below modern-day market rates and makes it difficult to get people out. <br /><br />So while a well-to-do family may live in a three-bedroom apartment in a choice part of town for just 250 rupees ($6.25) a month, newcomers are likely to pay 800 times that sum at $5,000 or more -- similar to rentals in London or New York. <br /><br />"Mumbai has been plagued by draconian urban regulations for the past 50 years," said Alain Bertrand, an urban development expert who previously worked for the World Bank. "(We must) find an equitable solution to get out of rent control." <br /><br />For the less well-off, there are plans to tear down one particular shantytown, Dharavi, a thriving slum considered to be one of Asia''s largest, and resettle families in high-rises. Many slum residents are opposed as they fear losing their livelihood. <br /><br />"It''s impossible to arrive in Mumbai and offer any solutions because everything is paled by the complexities of the problem," Ramanathan said. <br /><br />Authorities aim to attract $39 billion in private investment and Ubale says firms are interested in bidding for projects such as a light rail system in the north of the city. <br /><br />But implementation is fraught with problems. Bureaucracy, land acquisition and perhaps most importantly finding a fair solution to rehouse displaced people, estimated at 57,000 in the case of Dharavi alone, are a few of the obstacles. <br /><br />"It''s not just a question of funding, but of executing projects on time and maintaining them properly," Urban Development Minister S. Jaipal Reddy said. <br /><br />Despite all the challenges ahead, ICICI''s Kamath is upbeat on Mumbai''s progress towards becoming a world-class centre. <br /><br />"It may not happen tomorrow, but it is inevitable," he said.', '', 1, 5, 0, 13, '2008-04-23 18:52:44', 62, '', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 0, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2008-04-23 18:52:44', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', '', 'show_title=\nlink_titles=\nshow_intro=\nshow_section=\nlink_section=\nshow_category=\nlink_category=\nshow_vote=\nshow_author=\nshow_create_date=\nshow_modify_date=\nshow_pdf_icon=\nshow_print_icon=\nshow_email_icon=\nlanguage=\nkeyref=\nreadmore=', 1, 0, 8, '', '', 0, 0, 'robots=\nauthor='),

The Singapore dollar, the central bank''s main monetary policy tool, hit a record high. <br /><br />While economic growth in Asia is expected to slow this year as a struggling U.S. economy drags on the region''s exports, rising consumer prices have made it difficult for central banks to ease monetary policy. <br /><br />Prices in Singapore rose in March by 6.7 percent from a year earlier, their biggest annual gain since 1982. <br /><br />The core rate of annual inflation in Australia rose in the first quarter by a larger-than-expected 4.25 percent over a year earlier as the cost of eating, driving and renting all rose. <br /><br />SUPPLY SHOCKS <br /><br />Malaysia''s consumer prices climbed in March by a relatively sedate 2.8 percent from a year earlier, but that was still the highest level in well over a decade, although economists saw no reason for a rate hike. <br /><br />"Monetary policy can''t help much when inflation is driven by supply shocks," said Prakash Sakpal, a regional economist at ING Financial Markets in Singapore. <br /><br />"Central banks hiking interest rates is basically not an effective option. It basically leaves them with the exchange rate, which Singapore is doing," Sakpal said. <br /><br />Singapore''s central bank tightened monetary policy earlier this month by allowing the Singapore dollar, its main policy tool, to rise further. <br /><br />The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), the central bank, raised rates in both February and March to a 12-year high of 7.25 percent. But analysts said that may not be enough to contain the country''s inflation. <br /><br />"The RBA will be taking comfort from the rapid slowdown in demand seen in the first quarter, and that should allow them to skip another tightening for the time being," said Brian Radican, a senior economist at Macquarie bank. <br /><br />"But if inflation doesn''t slow by the third quarter, things could get nasty again," he said.

My first goal is to talk to other athletes there," said the 27-year-old Mendoza. <br /><br />She is one of a handful of Olympic athletes to sign up for Team Darfur, an informal, 300-strong group created two years ago by former American speed skater Joey Cheek to draw attention to the conflict affecting millions in western Sudan. <br /><br />International experts estimate that some 200,000 people have died and 2.5 million been driven from their homes since rebels took up arms in Darfur five years ago. Washington calls the violence genocide, a term European governments have been reluctant to use. <br /><br />China, which is a major investor in Sudan''s oil industry and the country''s largest supplier of weapons, has been accused by human rights groups of not doing enough to press the Sudanese government to end the bloodshed. It has also faced harsh criticism from Western governments for a bloody crackdown in Tibet. <br /><br />Mendoza, women''s soccer player Abby Wambach and some other athletes appearing at a U.S. team media summit ahead of the Games were struggling with a dilemma: a desire to express their views on the violence in Darfur and Tibet, while clinging to the belief that sport should be insulated from politics. <br /><br />"Are we human? Do we have consciousness? Of course. By winning the gold medal, we can best express our sense of unity," Wambach said. <br /><br /><br />LONG HOURS <br /><br />Several athletes said they did not want to violate what they described as the peaceful, communal spirit of the Olympics which features participants from more countries than there are members of the United Nations. <br /><br />They also wanted to avoid offending their Chinese hosts, distracting from their team mates'' achievements or risking their own long hours of training for a moment of controversy that might have little impact. <br /><br />"We are truly focused on our training," said gymnast Shayla Worley, 17. "We''re young...we leave all the political stuff to other people, that''s their job." <br /><br />Pro-Tibet protests following the Olympic torch relay have stolen headlines in the run-up to August''s Games. <br /><br />Politics has occasionally intruded on the Olympics in the form of boycotts, violence or excessive displays of nationalism, but China''s debut as hosts in the light of the Tibetan unrest has intensified political sentiments. <br /><br />Some have suggested that world leaders should consider boycotting the Games'' opening ceremony. Actress Mia Farrow sought a one-month "Olympic Truce" in Darfur and elsewhere but the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said it had "no political mandates to instruct countries how to behave". <br /><br />Film director Steven Spielberg withdrew from his role as an artistic advisor to the Games to protest at China''s inaction over Darfur. <br /><br />A few countries sought to have athletes sign pledges not to demonstrate in Beijing but backed off after a public outcry. Cheek said governments might be pressuring athletes not to speak out at the Olympics. <br /><br />U.S. Olympic Committee chief Jim Scherr said athletes were free to speak their minds but ought to do it privately and not violate Article 51 of the Olympic charter. <br /><br />The rule states: "No kind of demonstration or political, religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any Olympic sites, venues or other areas." <br /><br /><br />SENT HOME <br /><br />"I''m not going to ask anyone to (unfurl a protest banner) because it would risk them being sent home from the Olympics," Cheek said in a telephone interview from Princeton University where he is studying economics and Chinese. <br /><br />"That being said, making some sort of gesture, showing that you believe the Olympics can stand for more than just a sporting competition, that idea is sound," Cheek, 28, said. <br /><br />He said he understood the "fantastic pressure" athletes were under, having trained all their lives for a few moments in the spotlight. That spotlight also offered them a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to speak out, he added. <br /><br />Forty years ago, U.S. sprinters Tommie Smith and John Carlos grabbed the moment and faced scorn in some quarters for raising their fists in a black-power salute on the Olympic medals podium in a protest against racial discrimination. <br /><br />"They were expected to go to the Olympics, represent the U.S., win medals...and come home and be second-class citizens," Cheek said. <br /><br />Some in Mexico City that day sat in stunned confusion and the athletes were ostracised for some time after their long-planned protest, recalled Olympic historian John Lucas. <br /><br />At the 1936 Berlin Olympics, a subtle protest by Korean marathon winner Sohn Kee-chung went largely unnoticed for years, Lucas said.

Officials said the first of 23 recounts had confirmed victory in one constituency for the ruling ZANU-PF party, which lost control of parliament for the first time in the election. <br /><br /><br />RECOUNTS <br /><br />The recounts could overturn the MDC parliamentary victory. <br /><br />Analysts said Mazombwe holds no position in the ruling ZANU-PF party and his comments may not have official backing. <br /><br />"There is no likelihood of that. A government of national unity is highly unlikely if you consider ZANU-PF''s hardening attitude and rhetoric," said Lovemore Madhuku, a Mugabe critic and chairman of the National Constitutional Assembly pressure group. <br /><br />"That is reading too much into an opinion which does not reflect what we are witnessing on the ground," Madhuku said. <br /><br />Tsvangirai''s Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), human rights groups and Western powers accuse ZANU-PF of launching a campaign of post-election violence. <br /><br />Tsvangirai says 10-15 MDC supporters have already been killed in the crackdown. <br /><br />The opposition leader says he won the presidential election outright and Mugabe''s 28-year rule is over. <br /><br />The government has clearly indicated it expects a runoff -- necessary if neither candidate wins an absolute majority. Such a vote would be held three weeks after the result is announced. <br /><br />Further muddying the waters, Zimbabwe postponed an annual summit of Africa''s COMESA trading bloc which it was due to host in the first half of May -- suggesting the government may expect electoral developments in that period. <br /><br />Cape Town Archbishop Thabo Makgoba called for a U.N. arms embargo against Zimbabwe, saying the plight of its people was heartbreaking. <br /><br />He said the delay in releasing election results eroded "any remaining trust the people may have in the electoral process". <br /><br />The South African army said there had been a clear increase in the number of people fleeing Zimbabwe since the election with almost 1,800 illegal immigrants caught at the border. Millions of economic migrants have already fled. <br /><br />Zimbabwe''s neighbours, previously passive despite the collapse of the country''s economy, this week took a harder line towards Mugabe, refusing to allow a Chinese ship to unload arms headed for the landlocked country. <br /><br />The United States has led international calls for Africa to do more to end the Zimbabwe crisis. Washington''s chief Africa diplomat, Assistant Secretary of State Jendayi Frazer, was due in South Africa on a previously-arranged regional tour. <br /><br />Archbishop Makgoba, in a clear reference to President Thabo Mbeki''s softly softly approach to Zimbabwe, said South Africa''s leaders appeared to many outside the country to be "heartless and unmoved by the suffering of Zimbabweans".', '', 1, 7, 0, 21, '2008-04-23 19:50:04', 62, '', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 0, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2008-04-23 19:50:04', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', '', 'show_title=\nlink_titles=\nshow_intro=\nshow_section=\nlink_section=\nshow_category=\nlink_category=\nshow_vote=\nshow_author=\nshow_create_date=\nshow_modify_date=\nshow_pdf_icon=\nshow_print_icon=\nshow_email_icon=\nlanguage=\nkeyref=\nreadmore=', 1, 0, 1, '', '', 0, 0, 'robots=\nauthor='),

Bush held White House talks with Jordan''s King Abdullah on Wednesday as part of a diplomatic flurry this week aimed at shoring up the fragile Israeli-Palestinian peace process. <br /><br />Facing deep skepticism over his chances of forging a Middle East peace deal before he leaves office in January, Bush met Abdullah, an important player in regional diplomacy, on the eve of a meeting with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in Washington. <br /><br />Abdullah stressed the need for U.S. support for Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, telling Bush the talks "should be based on clear grounds and fixed timeframes," the Jordanian Embassy in Washington said in a statement. <br /><br />Negotiations between Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert have shown little progress since a U.S.-hosted conference in Annapolis, Maryland, in November, where they pledged to try to reach a peace deal by the end of the year. <br /><br />Bush failed to achieve any breakthroughs during a visit to the region in January, and he will travel to Israel again in mid-May to celebrate the Jewish state''s 60th anniversary and try to advance peace efforts. <br /><br />Bush, who once disdained a hands-on role in Middle East peacemaking, seems intent on using the waning months of his presidency to shape a foreign policy legacy that encompasses more than the unpopular war in Iraq. <br /><br />Many analysts say that if Israelis and Palestinians are to resolve their decades-old differences, it will require direct, sustained presidential engagement. But Bush has made clear he has no intention of adopting what his administration once derided as predecessor Bill Clinton''s "shoot the moon" approach to peacemaking that failed at the end of his presidency. <br /><br />INCREMENTAL STRATEGY <br /><br />Bush''s talks with Abdullah -- whose country is one of two Arab states to have signed a peace treaty with Israel -- fit a more incremental strategy of lessening any damage to U.S. prestige in the Arab world should the overall initiative fail. <br /><br />White House spokeswoman Dana Perino dismissed the notion that Bush might cancel his Israel trip unless there is some kind of deal at hand. "The president looks forward to going," she told reporters. <br /><br />Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was to meet Abbas on Wednesday to lay the groundwork for his talks with Bush. <br /><br />The Bush administration hopes to bolster Abbas, who essentially just controls the West bank after Hamas'' violent takeover of the Gaza Strip in June. <br /><br />Abbas wants U.S. pressure on Israel for a framework agreement that would outline the way sensitive final status issues can be resolved to establish a Palestinian state. <br /><br />"There is a chance and we don''t want it to be lost," Nabil Abu Rdainah, a senior Abbas aide, told Reuters. <br /><br />Olmert, also politically weak at home, has made clear he is looking for a vaguer list of "understandings." <br /><br />Negotiations have been bogged down by differences over Israeli settlement building in the occupied West Bank and violence in and around Gaza, where Hamas cross-border rocket fire has drawn an Israeli military response. <br /><br />In talks with Bush, Jordan''s Embassy said Abdullah told him Israel should refrain from "measures that would jeopardize negotiations with the Palestinians, and called for an end to all Israeli settlement activities, a lifting of the blockade and restrictions on the movement of Palestinians." <br /><br />Israel insists it is acting for its own security and self-defense, demands that the Palestinians do more to rein in militants and says it it has the right to build in large settlements it intends to keep in any final peace deal. <br /><br />Palestinian officials say if Abbas fails to win a framework deal by year-end, his credibility among his own people would be jeopardized and his Islamist rivals strengthened.', '', 1, 7, 0, 20, '2008-04-23 19:51:57', 62, '', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 0, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2008-04-23 19:51:57', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', '', 'show_title=\nlink_titles=\nshow_intro=\nshow_section=\nlink_section=\nshow_category=\nlink_category=\nshow_vote=\nshow_author=\nshow_create_date=\nshow_modify_date=\nshow_pdf_icon=\nshow_print_icon=\nshow_email_icon=\nlanguage=\nkeyref=\nreadmore=', 1, 0, 2, '', '', 0, 0, 'robots=\nauthor='),

"They see Carter as a messenger to both Israel and the United States. They may see this, erroneously in my view, as opening some kind of channel of communication." <br /><br />President George W. Bush has shunned and vilified Hamas, whose triumph in Palestinian elections in 2006 shocked a U.S. administration that was advocating democracy in the Arab world. <br /><br />Dismissing Carter''s outreach to Hamas as unhelpful, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice this week reiterated that President Mahmoud Abbas was the only Palestinian interlocutor. <br /><br />He embodied "the Palestinian leadership that has renounced violence and has negotiated with the Israeli government". <br /><br />Yet it remains unclear how Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert can advance toward the peace deal Bush had wanted by the end of 2008 while excluding Hamas, a powerful group which seized control of Gaza from Abbas''s Fatah faction last year. <br /><br />Carter''s overtures may have represented a modest step towards breaking an international boycott of Hamas, at little cost to itself, but are unlikely to open any doors in the United States under the next president, let alone the incumbent. <br /><br /><br />PRICE TOO STEEP <br /><br />"Even in a successor administration, direct dialogue is unlikely," said Nathan Brown, senior associate at the Washington-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. <br /><br />"The U.S. conditions -- acceptance of Israel, renunciation of violence, acceptance of past (Israeli-Palestinian) agreements -- are simply too steep a price for Hamas," Brown declared. <br /><br />Democratic White House contender Barack Obama on Tuesday described Carter''s talks with Hamas as a "bad idea". <br /><br />Hamas has in the past agreed that Abbas, as head of the PLO, could negotiate with Israel. Meshaal told Carter that any peace agreement reached must be subject to a referendum, preceded by reconciliation between Hamas and the secular Fatah faction. <br /><br />For now the two sides remain bitterly divided, with Fatah demanding that Hamas cede control of Gaza before any Palestinian power-sharing accord is reached. That makes it hard to see how any deal that Abbas might strike with Israel could stick. <br /><br />"It would be impossible for such an agreement to be properly ratified or implemented in the context of a continued schism between the two largest (Palestinian) movements," Rabbani said. <br /><br />Israel, which judged that Carter''s talks had produced "no change in Hamas''s extremist positions", is itself dealing with the Islamist group, albeit indirectly via Egyptian mediators. <br /><br />A Palestinian official familiar with those talks said he expected Hamas to reach an agreement with Israel this week on a reciprocal truce "in the Gaza Strip, at this stage". Hamas has previously insisted any ceasefire apply also to the West Bank. <br /><br />Carter had urged Hamas to agree a unilateral halt to rocket fire into Israel from Gaza, but Meshaal turned him down. <br /><br />"They (Hamas) said they''d prefer to continue and conclude the discussions with the Egyptians, which is another way of saying ''the Israelis are offering us more than you are, why should we accept your proposal?''," Rabbani said. <br /><br />Israel and Hamas might each have an interest in such pragmatic deals, without shedding their mutual hostility. <br /><br />"Some Israelis are interested in pursuing a modus vivendi with Hamas because they think that any comprehensive settlement ...is beyond reach at this point anyway," Carnegie''s Brown said. <br /><br />But the Israeli government does not want outsiders like Carter to help Hamas gain status as a negotiating partner -- even if that might improve prospects for a two-state solution. <br /><br />"The decision-makers want to retain the severe international isolation of Hamas and worry about any breach in that wall," Brown added.', '', 1, 7, 0, 19, '2008-04-23 19:58:23', 62, '', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 0, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2008-04-23 19:58:23', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', '', 'show_title=\nlink_titles=\nshow_intro=\nshow_section=\nlink_section=\nshow_category=\nlink_category=\nshow_vote=\nshow_author=\nshow_create_date=\nshow_modify_date=\nshow_pdf_icon=\nshow_print_icon=\nshow_email_icon=\nlanguage=\nkeyref=\nreadmore=', 1, 0, 3, '', '', 0, 0, 'robots=\nauthor='),

Soldiers returned fire, killing six gunmen. <br /><br />In another incident, it said an unmanned drone spotted two militants putting a mortar tube into a vehicle and then driving off. The drone fired a Hellfire missile, killing the two. <br /><br />"Along with our Iraqi security forces partners, we are targeting individual terrorists, criminal networks, and anyone involved in violent crimes against the Iraqi people," said U.S. Lieutenant-Colonel Steven Stover, a spokesman in Baghdad. <br /><br />Maliki has refused to back down in his confrontation with Sadr. The cleric backed the prime minister''s rise to power in 2006 but has since split with him over Maliki''s refusal to set a timetable for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq. <br /><br />At a meeting of foreign ministers from the region and Western powers in Kuwait on Tuesday, Maliki noted he had strong political support for his campaign to disarm militias. <br /><br />Maliki has threatened to bar Sadr''s movement from provincial elections on Oct. 1 if he does not disband the Mehdi Army. <br /><br />Sadr''s mass movement, which boycotted the last local elections in 2005, is expected to perform well at the expense of parties that backed Maliki, especially in the Shi''ite south.', '', 1, 7, 0, 19, '2008-04-23 19:59:48', 62, '', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 0, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2008-04-23 19:59:48', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', '', 'show_title=\nlink_titles=\nshow_intro=\nshow_section=\nlink_section=\nshow_category=\nlink_category=\nshow_vote=\nshow_author=\nshow_create_date=\nshow_modify_date=\nshow_pdf_icon=\nshow_print_icon=\nshow_email_icon=\nlanguage=\nkeyref=\nreadmore=', 1, 0, 1, '', '', 0, 0, 'robots=\nauthor='),
(63, 'Australia resorts to ''dynamic'' torch relay', 'australia-resorts-to-dynamic-torch-relay', '', 'Australian police promised on Wednesday a "dynamic" torch relay to dodge protesters when the Olympic flame travels the Australian leg of its troubled journey around the world. <br /><br />China had hoped the torch''s progress would be a symbol of unity in the run-up to the Beijing Games, but at several previous relays the flame has drawn anti-China protests over human rights and Beijing''s crackdown in Tibet, as well as pro-China demonstrations. <br /><br />The Australian relay is on Thursday, but Pro-Tibet demonstrators have already beamed laser signs onto the iconic Sydney Harbour Bridge reading "Don''t Torch Tibet", and a group of Tibetans on hunger strike was on a 70 km (43 mile) march to Canberra to rally against the torch relay. <br /><br />The flame landed at an air force base in the capital under the kind of protection usually afforded visiting world leaders. <br /><br />Thousands of pro-Tibet supporters have promised peaceful rallies during Thursday''s torch relay, while thousands of Chinese students were expected to rally in support of China. <br /><br />The Olympic torch''s appearance worldwide has been marked by heavy security and sharply curtailed celebrations. Tibet supporters disrupted the relay in London, Paris and San Francisco, prompting officials to boost security and shorten the torch relay in India, Malaysia and Indonesia. <br /><br />Australian organisers have dropped plans to run the torch past the Chinese embassy, near Australia''s national parliament, fearing the embassy could become a flashpoint for protests. <br /><br />Hundreds of extra police have been called in to protect the flame, which will be carried by 80 runners through barricaded streets on Thursday. <br /><br />Media reports said the Chinese embassy had hired 20 buses to bring supporters from Sydney and the southern city of Melbourne, an eight-hour drive from Canberra, to counter protesters. <br /><br />"We''re in a democratic country. If people want to protest, that''s a matter for them, as long as they do it peacefully," International Olympic spokesman Kevan Gosper told Reuters after watching the torch arrive. <br /><br />Aborigine Bunja Smith, who presented Chinese torch officials in Canberra with a traditional wooden message stick inscribed with the word "Peace", said Australia''s Aborigines understood the need for protest. <br /><br />"We are a people who have been repressed, but we ask the protesters to keep it a protest and not violent," he said. Australia''s five-time Olympic gold medal swimmer Ian Thorpe, who will run the final leg of the Canberra relay, said he also understood why people were demonstrating. <br /><br />"I''d just like to think that if you are going to protest on issues like this, it shouldn''t be centred around a particular event," said Thorpe. <br /><br />Relay organiser Ted Quinlan said he did not expect clashes, while a spokeswoman for China''s Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday she was confident the Canberra torch relay would be a success. <br /><br />DYNAMIC ROUTE <br /><br />Canberra police commander Mike Phelan said the torch route, expected to start with a lake-crossing, would have contingencies in place if expected protests turned violent. <br /><br />"The route as published is something that will be dynamic on the day," he said. <br /><br />Phelan stressed Australian police alone would handle security after Beijing Olympic Committee Spokesman Qu Yingpu hinted Chinese attendants could step in, prompting hurried denials from city officials. <br /><br />The chaotic scenes and perceived biased Western media coverage of the Tibet riots and the torch disruptions have sparked an outpouring of patriotic fervour among Chinese in and outside China. <br /><br />Chinese Internet users have rushed to send thousands of red national flags overseas to support the troubled torch relay ahead of the Olympics, state media said.', '', 1, 7, 0, 18, '2008-04-23 20:00:35', 62, '', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 0, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2008-04-23 20:00:35', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', '', 'show_title=\nlink_titles=\nshow_intro=\nshow_section=\nlink_section=\nshow_category=\nlink_category=\nshow_vote=\nshow_author=\nshow_create_date=\nshow_modify_date=\nshow_pdf_icon=\nshow_print_icon=\nshow_email_icon=\nlanguage=\nkeyref=\nreadmore=', 1, 0, 3, '', '', 0, 0, 'robots=\nauthor='),

(http://www.e-koito.com) <br /><br />"I wanted to know more about my own country and that''s why I chose this world," Komomo told Reuters. <br /><br />Dressed in a formal crested black kimono with a brocade sash, her face covered in white makeup with just a touch of red at the eyes, she added: "I wanted to make Japanese history and customs a part of my daily life, not just wearing a kimono occasionally but every day and living life as they did in the old days." <br /><br />But this seemed impossible until she found Koito''s website, one of the first written by a working geisha. <br /><br />"I was so excited that I e-mailed Koito-san right away, telling her my dream of becoming a maiko, an apprentice geisha, but that I didn''t know how to begin," she wrote. <br /><br />The two corresponded for three years, until Komomo graduated from junior high school. Shrugging off the opposition of her parents, who wanted her to take a more conventional path of university and marriage, the 15-year-old headed for Kyoto. <br /><br />"I thought she wouldn''t last," said Kimiko Nasu, Komomo''s mother, who was visiting her only child. "She has a strong will, and in the geisha world you have to make yourself disappear." <br /><br />LESSONS DRIVEN HOME <br /><br />Komomo moved into Koito''s okiya in Miyagawa-cho, a cluster of narrow, stone-paved streets lined with wooden houses in central Kyoto. Her first weeks were spent learning to greet people with polite bows, wear kimono, and speak in the soft Kyoto dialect. <br /><br />"In the first year, every single day, it seemed I was scolded all the time. That was my job, to be scolded," said Komomo, who stands barely 150 cm (4 ft 11 inches) tall. <br /><br />"At evening gatherings, no mistakes are permitted, and this isn''t something you can just learn suddenly. It has to be driven home, as part of your daily life, so you won''t do anything embarrassing in front of the guests." <br /><br />Each demanding day begins with lessons in dance, singing, tea ceremony and music, and continues with parties -- the geisha''s real work -- from six until midnight. <br /><br />With only one day off every two or three months, Komomo at first sometimes longed for the life of an ordinary teenager, able to see movies on a whim. <br /><br />But she only thought of quitting briefly, during her first two weeks, when another girl decided to leave. <br /><br />"I realised then what my true feelings were. I thought, since I decided to do this, I might as well try really hard." <br /><br />Wearing an elaborate maiko kimono with long sleeves and a wide, trailing sash, and learning to walk in the costume without bumping into anything or anyone, especially during dance performances, was hard. Komomo also forgot rules and lost hair ornaments. <br /><br />"In our okiya we didn''t cry that much," she said. "My time in China was actually much harder at first." <br /><br />Komomo''s life overseas -- born in Mexico, she spent some years in Japan before moving to China -- has been a plus by helping her break the ice with guests. But there were problems. <br /><br />"At first I think I had some friction with ordinary life in Japan, and I was a bit cheeky. Here they say it''s best to act as if you know nothing, but actually be really clever. <br /><br />"Every so often, I got conceited from all the attention, but somebody soon brought me down to earth," Komomo said of her five years as a maiko. <br /><br />"It was actually refreshing to finally become a geisha because you''re not forced to be ''on'' for 24 hours a day." <br /><br />She declined to say what she earns, but bystanders at the theatre where she took part in a dance performance said she is popular. She owns a house, and its main room boasts a huge flat-screen TV and new model Macintosh computer. <br /><br />"I was told when I began that I''m not an incredible beauty so I should try to always keep a smile on my face. Beauties get work easily, but I need to work at it," she said. <br /><br />FUTURE FEARS <br /><br />Even so, she confessed to worries about the future. There are no pensions for geisha and they are not permitted to marry, though in the past some were supported as mistresses. Some even became single mothers. <br /><br />Though Komomo says she wants children, she has only been a geisha for two years and hasn''t thought about the future yet. <br /><br />"I don''t even have a boyfriend," she said. "I''m too busy to meet anyone, and the guests at the parties are my father''s age." <br /><br />Of greater concern is the fate of the geisha world itself. <br /><br />Geisha numbers in Japan peaked at 80,000 in 1928, but now only 1,000 are left. One of the six geisha districts in tradition-bound Kyoto has folded due to lack of business. <br /><br />The economic woes of the 1990s slashed the expense accounts of business executives who were once the mainstays of geisha, while politicians now shun lavish spending after scandals. <br /><br />A dinner with a geisha present can cost around 80,000 yen ($785) a person, depending on the venue and the number of geisha. <br /><br />Another problem is that men today tend to prefer less formal entertainment like karaoke or hostess bars. <br /><br />Many people, including Komomo, say the geisha world needs to open up more, and they say the Internet is an ideal tool. <br /><br />"In the old days, people only got to know geisha through introductions, but now people rely on the Internet to gather information," said Kyoko Aihara, a geisha expert and author. <br /><br />"Miyagawa-cho has introduced themselves on the net. They''re more flexible than some of the more traditional geisha areas, they want people to have fun -- and this is working for them." <br /><br />In a move to gently ease neophytes into the geisha world, Koito, who trained Komomo, runs an elegant bar on the first floor of her okiya where guests can meet geisha for relatively inexpensive prices. <br /><br />"History changes, so if you just offer the same thing it''s no good," she said. "The service you provide has to match the age." <br /><br />"We need to keep providing things the world needs," she added. "If we''re not needed anymore, all we can do is disappear." <br /><br />($1=101.89 Yen)', '', 1, 7, 0, 18, '2008-04-23 20:01:39', 62, '', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 0, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2008-04-23 20:01:39', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', '', 'show_title=\nlink_titles=\nshow_intro=\nshow_section=\nlink_section=\nshow_category=\nlink_category=\nshow_vote=\nshow_author=\nshow_create_date=\nshow_modify_date=\nshow_pdf_icon=\nshow_print_icon=\nshow_email_icon=\nlanguage=\nkeyref=\nreadmore=', 1, 0, 2, '', '', 0, 0, 'robots=\nauthor='),

U.S. rice futures rose to an all-time high on Wednesday. <br /><br />"If we restrict trade, we''re simply going to add food scarcity to the already large problems of food shortages that exist in different countries," Mandelson said in an interview during a visit to Tokyo with an EU delegation. <br /><br />"The WTO stands for free trade. It needs to exert its pressure and influence to reduce tariffs and thereby encourage trade," he added. <br /><br />"It''s also got to stand up against export restrictions, export taxes, which too will stop the free flow of trade in foodstuffs and agricultural produce." <br /><br />Mandelson''s comments came a day after a concerned Japan, which relies on imports for much of its food, said it would propose the WTO set clear rules on food export restrictions. <br /><br />Trade bans on rice have been put in place by India, the world''s second largest exporter in 2007, and Vietnam, the third biggest, in the hopes of cooling domestic prices of the staple food. <br /><br />The export curbs have been criticised by the Asian Development Bank, which said Asian governments were over-reacting to surging food prices by resorting to market-distorting measures. <br /><br />In Thailand, the world''s largest rice exporter, farmers have planted a rare third crop and are expected to reap another 1.6 million tonnes of rice paddy this year. <br /><br />An incomplete 500,000 tonne tender by Manila last week has reinforced a perception in the Thai rice industry that demand is far outstripping supply, suggesting prices are set to continue the unprecedented surge of the last four months, exporters said. <br /><br />FOOD SPURS DOHA TALKS <br /><br />Mandelson said concerns over food and global financial turmoil were spurring progress towards an agreement on the Doha round of WTO negotiations, which aims to forge a deal to liberalise world trade. <br /><br />The next ministerial meeting on the Doha round may be held in late May or June, after speculation it could be in the week of May 19, Kyodo news agency quoted Mandelson as saying on Tuesday. <br /><br />European Commission President Jose Manual Barroso and Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda on Wednesday expressed "strong concern" about rising food and fuel prices and agreed on the urgent need to address the issue, especially in developing countries. <br /><br />Mandelson and other European Commission officials leave Japan on Thursday for China, hoping to resolve disagreements over climate change and trade.', '', 1, 7, 0, 18, '2008-04-23 20:02:27', 62, '', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 0, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2008-04-23 20:02:27', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', '', 'show_title=\nlink_titles=\nshow_intro=\nshow_section=\nlink_section=\nshow_category=\nlink_category=\nshow_vote=\nshow_author=\nshow_create_date=\nshow_modify_date=\nshow_pdf_icon=\nshow_print_icon=\nshow_email_icon=\nlanguage=\nkeyref=\nreadmore=', 1, 0, 1, '', '', 0, 0, 'robots=\nauthor=');

The group''s products range from computer chips and handphones to supertankers. <br /><br />"I will step down from the Samsung chairman position today. I am saddened as there is still much to do and a way to go," an apologetic but expressionless Lee said in a brief statement broadcast on national television. <br /><br />The group will dismantle its powerful strategic planning office, which critics say is an opaque organisation able to wield influence across some 60 affiliates, including flagship company Samsung Electronics, a world leader in computer memory chips and flat display screens. <br /><br />"I don''t see anything more than a change of people in charge. There''s no change at all in the fact that (the Lee family) will remain the owner," said Oh Suk-tae, an economist at Citibank. <br /><br />Lee''s son, Lee Jae-yong, seen as being groomed to take over, will step down from his executive post and work abroad for the group in another, unspecified role. <br /><br />Four other top executives also quit, including the head of the group''s strategic division and the CEOs of Samsung Fire and Marine Insurance and Samsung Securities Co Ltd. <br /><br />Shares in affiliates such as Samsung Securities and Samsung Construction & Trading fell by 4-8 percent on the news, that stunned markets and a public fascinated by the reclusive Lee, one of South Korea''s richest men and most revered business leaders. <br /><br />Samsung group firms account for 20 percent of total market capitalisation on the main board of the South Korean bourse. <br /><br />The group has more than 250,000 employees and its annual revenues of $160 billion are around the size of Singapore''s GDP. <br /><br />NO BANKING <br /><br />On two key issues, Samsung said it would not move into the banking sector, nor would it set up a holding company. <br /><br />There has been widespread speculation that once the government eases restrictions, the major family-run "chaebol", or conglomerates, would snap up local banks. <br /><br />A special prosecutor in January launched a probe into corruption allegations after a former top legal executive at the group said some of its top management hid money and kept a slush fund to bribe politicians, prosecutors and officials. <br /><br />The prosecutor indicted nine other Samsung executives. But it found no evidence to support the bribery allegation. <br /><br />If found guilty of tax evasion Lee could serve from five years to life in jail. <br /><br />South Korean conglomerates powered South Korea from the ashes of the 1950-53 Korean War to become Asia''s fourth-largest economy, but have been accused for years of creating impenetrable management structures. <br /><br />Critics say few changes have been made over the years at the family-run business groups, despite a number of high-profile convictions of their leaders. <br /><br />"This cannot be considered a major reform measure even with Lee stepping down, because the management structure of Samsung is built up so that he can influence it as he wishes anyway," said Park Won-suk, a senior official with the People''s Solidarity for Participatory Democracy. <br /><br />"We see this announcement as one with perhaps symbolic and visible results, but all the essential points related to the management structure are not included. It failed to address the core of the issue," said Park, whose group has for years called for reform of Samsung management practices. <br /><br />In contrast, pro-business groups have voiced concerns that the probe has delayed important management decisions at Samsung. <br /><br />The Korean Federation of Industries called the announcement "shocking".', '', 1, 7, 0, 17, '2008-04-23 20:03:27', 62, '', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 0, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2008-04-23 20:03:27', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', '', 'show_title=\nlink_titles=\nshow_intro=\nshow_section=\nlink_section=\nshow_category=\nlink_category=\nshow_vote=\nshow_author=\nshow_create_date=\nshow_modify_date=\nshow_pdf_icon=\nshow_print_icon=\nshow_email_icon=\nlanguage=\nkeyref=\nreadmore=', 1, 0, 3, '', '', 0, 0, 'robots=\nauthor='),

India responded late on Tuesday by saying that it did not need "any guidance" on conducting its bilateral relations. <br /><br />"Both nations are perfectly capable of managing all aspects of their relationship with the appropriate degree of care and attention," the Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement. <br /><br />India will also hope to improve diplomatic relations with Tehran after it voted against Iran at the International Atomic Energy Agency in 2006, as well as its launch of an Israeli spy satellite earlier this year. <br /><br />DAMAGE CONTROL <br /><br />"India is now eager to repair the damage and is looking at its long-term strategic interest by playing their Iran card, like on energy issues," said Brahma Chellaney at the Centre for Policy Research. <br /><br />India has been boycotting trilateral meetings on the Iran pipeline since mid-2007, citing it first wanted to resolve the issues of transit fees and transportation tariffs with Pakistan. <br /><br />The proposed pipeline would initially carry 60 million cubic metres (2.2 billion cubic feet) of gas daily to Pakistan and India, half for each country. The capacity would be raised to 150 million cubic metres at a later date. <br /><br />India''s Petroleum Minister Murli Deora is also visiting Pakistan this week to talk about the pipeline, the first formal contact between the two countries since a new coalition government took office in Islamabad last month, according to state-run media. <br /><br />There have been no indications India will discuss nuclear technology with the Iranian president. <br /><br />In the early 1990s, India was reported to have offered some help on building a civilian research reactor in Iran under international safeguards but backed down after U.S. pressure. There have been no reported offers of assistance since, Chellaney said. <br /><br />India has invested in civilian nuclear reactors to help fulfil its increasing power demand and plans to nearly double capacity by 2011. India conducted a nuclear weapons test in 1998, leading then to sanctions from the United States. <br /><br />Under discussion will be the role of Indian companies in the development of Iran''s energy sector amid U.S. pressure not to invest in the country. <br /><br />Last year, India''s privately run firm Essar backed down from setting up a refinery in Iran that would have violated U.S. sanctions. <br /><br />Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), India''s top explorer, has been in talks to develop oil and gas fields in Iran. <br /><br />Iran has the world''s second-largest reserves of oil and gas, and sees companies in India as less susceptible than many others to Western pressure over Tehran''s nuclear programme.', '', 1, 7, 0, 16, '2008-04-23 20:05:42', 62, '', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 0, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2008-04-23 20:05:42', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', '', 'show_title=\nlink_titles=\nshow_intro=\nshow_section=\nlink_section=\nshow_category=\nlink_category=\nshow_vote=\nshow_author=\nshow_create_date=\nshow_modify_date=\nshow_pdf_icon=\nshow_print_icon=\nshow_email_icon=\nlanguage=\nkeyref=\nreadmore=', 1, 0, 4, '', '', 0, 2, 'robots=\nauthor='),

Kamath, chief executive of ICICI Bank, India''s largest private bank, told a conference recently. <br /><br />"That is the catch-up time that we need to build various structures whether they are financial or whether they are real ... to provide the sort of momentum that we need." <br /><br />Formerly known as Bombay, Mumbai is a bustling port on India''s west coast. Home to 17 million people, it is already a base for two stock markets, their watchdog and the central bank. <br /><br />The city which overlooks the Arabian Sea is the face of old and new India: bullock carts toil alongside shiny sedans, shanties slope from walls near glazed offices, and sea vistas take your breath away with the low-tide stench of sewage. <br /><br />But India''s central government envisages a time when Mumbai will be a gleaming financial hub not too far removed from London, Dubai and Singapore. <br /><br />To this end it has appointed a panel to study ways of turning Mumbai into the sort of place where a high-rolling banker might want to live. <br /><br />Democratic government, a vast and growing economy, a large English-speaking workforce and a time zone overlapping Asia and Europe all work in the city''s favour, although markets need to be liberalised and the financial and legal system must improve. <br /><br />But financial reforms are nothing compared to the Herculean task of revamping Mumbai''s infrastructure and housing, an initiative that will probably cost tens of billions of dollars. <br /><br />HERCULEAN TASK <br /><br />With its pockets of faded British colonial grandeur, Mumbai is beset by infrastructure problems: debilitating traffic, a lack of housing, poor water delivery, with some homes served simply by water trucks, and an unreliable power system that results in routine power cuts in the suburbs. <br /><br />Even the geography of the city, a series of islands joined by reclamation, works against it. Space is at a premium and the city is getting increasingly cramped as an estimated 300 poor families arrive each day in search of work. <br /><br />The city''s infrastructure is rusty and overloaded. Six million people a day cram into -- or on top of -- its battered commuter trains. <br /><br />Efforts are underway to modernise the infrastructure, but observers say the massive sums of money involved are just a drop in the ocean. <br /><br />The Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai has budgeted 18 billion rupees ($450 million) to upgrade roads and bridges and 29 billion rupees to improve water supply this fiscal year. <br /><br />"Our journey on urban investment is just beginning," Ramesh Ramanathan, founder of the group Janaagraha, which pushes for civic reform, told a conference recently. <br /><br />"These numbers are insignificant ... compared to the true amount of money that will have to be invested in infrastructure over the next 15 to 20 years," he said. <br /><br />Officials are tackling some issues: corporation figures show 19 billion rupees allocated to widen century-old storm drains after about 1,000 people died in severe monsoon floods in 2005. <br /><br />Sanjay Ubale, secretary of special projects for the state of Maharashtra, of which Mumbai is the capital, says 250 new trains are on the way. <br /><br />Last year, a law that controlled urban land holdings was scrapped, potentially freeing large areas for development. <br /><br />High-rises increasingly dot the skyline and a second international airport is planned for the city''s outskirts. <br /><br />DEMOCRACY, BUREAUCRACY <br /><br />Further progress is hampered by miles of red tape and the housing shortage is not helped by a 1947 rent control act, that keeps rents for long-time tenants far below modern-day market rates and makes it difficult to get people out. So while a well-to-do family may live in a three-bedroom apartment in a choice part of town for just 250 rupees ($6.25) a month, newcomers are likely to pay 800 times that sum at $5,000 or more -- similar to rentals in London or New York. <br /><br />"Mumbai has been plagued by draconian urban regulations for the past 50 years," said Alain Bertrand, an urban development expert who previously worked for the World Bank. "(We must) find an equitable solution to get out of rent control." <br /><br />For the less well-off, there are plans to tear down one particular shantytown, Dharavi, a thriving slum considered to be one of Asia''s largest, and resettle families in high-rises. Many slum residents are opposed as they fear losing their livelihood. <br /><br />"It''s impossible to arrive in Mumbai and offer any solutions because everything is paled by the complexities of the problem," Ramanathan said. <br /><br />Authorities aim to attract $39 billion in private investment and Ubale says firms are interested in bidding for projects such as a light rail system in the north of the city. <br /><br />But implementation is fraught with problems. Bureaucracy, land acquisition and perhaps most importantly finding a fair solution to rehouse displaced people, estimated at 57,000 in the case of Dharavi alone, are a few of the obstacles. <br /><br />"It''s not just a question of funding, but of executing projects on time and maintaining them properly," federal Urban Development Minister S. Jaipal Reddy said. <br /><br />Despite all the challenges ahead, ICICI''s Kamath is upbeat on Mumbai''s progress towards becoming a world-class centre. <br /><br />"It may not happen tomorrow, but it is inevitable," he said.', '', 1, 7, 0, 16, '2008-04-23 20:06:19', 62, '', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 0, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2008-04-23 20:06:19', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', '', 'show_title=\nlink_titles=\nshow_intro=\nshow_section=\nlink_section=\nshow_category=\nlink_category=\nshow_vote=\nshow_author=\nshow_create_date=\nshow_modify_date=\nshow_pdf_icon=\nshow_print_icon=\nshow_email_icon=\nlanguage=\nkeyref=\nreadmore=', 1, 0, 3, '', '', 0, 2, 'robots=\nauthor='),

This has gone too far. We are too plugged-in,''" said Sarmiento, a 30-something virtual business owner and professional blogger in Alabama. <br /><br />"It''s like our mind is going in a million different directions all the time. So taking a day when you are completely cut off from technology forces you to re-engage with the real world," she said. <br /><br />Some call it the "secular Sabbath." For others it is "unplugged day." In Quebec, Canada, professional computer developers Denis Bystrov and Ashutosh Rajekar are organizing a global "Shutdown Day" in May. <br /><br />Stallings, 33, a Seattle author, blogger and part-time marketing manager for Microsoft Corp, made a resolution in January to spend "52 Nights Unplugged" this year. <br /><br />"I love technology. I''m not a Luddite. But I realized it was a problem when I would sit down to check my email and it was almost like I would wake up six hours later and find I was watching videos of puppies on YouTube. <br /><br />"I''d try and think what I had been doing for the past two hours and I had no idea. I associate that kind of time loss with blackouts when you''re drunk," she said. <br /><br />So Stallings took the plunge, accompanied by twitchy emotional withdrawal symptoms, and turned off her computer, email, cellphone and television on Wednesday nights. <br /><br />In an ironic twist, she quickly spread the word through her blog (http://52nightsunplugged.ning.com), and connected with thousands of people across the world who habitually text while driving, take their laptops to the bathroom, or check e-mail during dinner. <br /><br />"I thought it was just a problem that affected me and my geeky colleagues. But then I started hearing from Italians with similar issues, and Poles and Czechs, and I even got a query from someone in Colombia. <br /><br />"So I realize it''s not just an American problem but an international one," Stallings said. <br /><br />THOU SHALT UNPLUG <br /><br />Dr. Dave Greenfield, who runs the Center for Internet Behavior in Connecticut, said most people thought it was a joke when he first started warning about compulsive Internet use in his 1999 book "Virtual Addiction." <br /><br />Greenfield said various studies estimate that 1 to 10 percent of the U.S. population uses technology in a way that negatively impacts their lives, relationships, health or jobs. <br /><br />But he says it''s rare for any kind of addict -- be it to drugs, alcohol, gambling or technology -- to take the kind of initiative seen by the unplugged movement. <br /><br />"It is very unusual for somebody to present for help without having been dragged there by a parent or loved one, unless they have gotten in trouble with the law or with their job," he said. <br /><br />"The collective denial that any culture has around new technology takes a long time to erode," Greenfield said. <br /><br />Sarmiento, who writes a blog called eSoup (http://www.esoupblog.com/), said she has taken up painting again and become involved in volunteer projects since beginning her own "digital day of rest" two months ago. <br /><br />Now she sometimes unplugs for an entire weekend. "I had to work up to that," she admits. "It is nice. It feels like you are going on a little retreat. It has opened up more quality of life for me." <br /><br />"I have dream blogged.

Peak-hour load shedding was fixed at 658 MW. <br /><br />Power Development Board officials said the daytime load shortage on Sunday stood at 275 MW, while demand for the period crossed 4,000 MW from eight in the morning. <br /><br />Some areas of Dhaka experienced power outages up to six times over the day, with outages continuing for up to one-and-a-half hours. <br /><br />Various government efforts to save power have so far proved ineffective: including advice to households to rely more on their own generators during peak hours. <br /><br />The city corporation also considered shutting down the street lights on one side of certain roads in the city in addition to advising limited use of air conditioning systems. <br /><br />PDB officials said up to 400 MW could be saved if the use of air conditioning could be limited. <br /><br />Titas Gas Transmission and Distribution Company has asked certain industrial units to minimise their use of power by 40 percent during peak hours to increase the gas supply to power plants. <br /><br />However, none of the business owners has responded to the ministry directive. <br /><br />WASA''s managing director for Dhaka, Raihanul Abedin, told bdnews24.com that the government''s request to close water tank pumps during peak hours was impractical. <br /><br />"There is not a water crisis in the WASA area. There are problems in one or two areas but it will be OK. We are attempting to solve any problems using generators in certain areas," said Abedin. <br /><br />Meanwhile, the Met Office''s chief meteorologist, Sujit Kumar Deb Sharma, told bdnews24.com that the elevated temperatures were likely to continue, although possible storms at the end of the month would bring the temperature down. <br /><br />The weather forecast until 6pm Monday said a mild-to-medium heat wave would continue through Dhaka, Rajshahi, Khulna and Barisal divisions. <br /><br />A temporary gusty wind may blow over Tangail, Mymensingh and Comilla regions in addition to one or two places over Rajshahi and Sylhet divisions. <br /><br />Partial cloud cover will remain, although it is unlikely to rain.

This year new regulations allow women to stay in hotels without a guardian. <br /><br />But clerics of the state-sanctioned school of Islamic law, a strict form of Sunni Islam often termed Wahhabism, see the "muhrim", or guardian of women''s honour, as central to the system of social and moral control in place in the country. <br /><br />The rules -- the subject of heated national debate -- are enforced by the judiciary and a morals police body, both of which are run by Wahhabi clerics. <br /><br />"The authorities essentially treat adult women like legal minors who are not entitled to authority over their lives and well-being," the HRW report says, citing a list of complaints based on interviews with about 100 women. <br /><br />It says women cannot open bank accounts for children, enrol them in school, obtain school files, or travel with their children without written permission from the child''s father. <br /><br />Women are also prevented from accessing government agencies that have not established female sections unless they have a male representative, and the need to establish separate office space discourages firms from hiring women, it said. <br /><br />Deif said the authorities had placed women in an impossible situation by holding them criminally responsible for their actions from puberty at the same time as imposing legal guardianship upon them.', '', 1, 9, 0, 23, '2008-04-23 20:51:44', 62, '', '2008-11-24 19:49:08', 72, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2008-04-23 20:51:44', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', '', 'show_title=\nlink_titles=\nshow_intro=\nshow_section=\nlink_section=\nshow_category=\nlink_category=\nshow_vote=\nshow_author=\nshow_create_date=\nshow_modify_date=\nshow_pdf_icon=\nshow_print_icon=\nshow_email_icon=\nlanguage=\nkeyref=\nreadmore=', 2, 0, 2, '', '', 0, 11, 'robots=\nauthor=');

But Hadfield sees MalariaEngage.org as more than a fundraising tool. <br /><br />"MalariaEngage.org increases the return on investment of donors by connecting them directly with researchers working on malaria prevention treatment," said Hadfield. <br /><br />"It''s about more than about giving money -- it''s about creating connections. By encouraging individual participation and involvement, we will create international communities of common interest. This is the essence of social networking." <br /><br />The seven projects were recommended by Tanzania''s National Institute for Medical Research and once those have been funded, MalariaEngage.org will look to support new schemes across developing countries. <br /><br />Due to marry in November, Hadfield co-founded the site with health professors Peter A.

The industry is also being asked to spend more on advertising its symbols denoting the age suitability of games. <br /><br />"When children go out to play today they enter the world of joysticks. We are not quite sure where they go and there is real anxiety from parents," EU Consumer Protection Commissioner Meglena Kuneva said. <br /><br />The industry''s age classification system -- Pan European Games Information (PEGI) -- is sponsored by more than 200 industry members and used in 20 of the 27 EU states.

Carl Winter, director of the Food Safety Program at the University of California-Davis, said in a telephone interview. <br /><br />"There still does not exist strong evidence supporting significant impacts on human health for bisphenol A," he said. <br /><br />"NEGLIGIBLE RISK" <br /><br />Steven Hentges of the American Chemistry Council downplayed the animal studies, saying they "have not been corroborated between labs and the entire data set is not coherent." <br /><br />He added: "We do believe that bisphenol A poses negligible risk to human health." <br /><br />On Tuesday the National Toxicology Program, part of the U.S. government''s National Institutes of Health, issued a draft report expressing concern that BPA could cause neural and behavioral problems in fetuses, infants and children. <br /><br />Relying on the results of animal studies, it expressed concern about possible links between BPA exposure and early puberty and prostate and breast cancer. <br /><br />Dr. Anila Jacob of the activist Environmental Working Group said using rodent studies to assess toxicity is a well-established practice given that scientists cannot expose humans to possible toxins in research for ethical reasons. <br /><br />Canadian Health Minister Tony Clement said on Friday his country intends to become the first to ban the import and sale of some types of plastic baby bottles because they contain BPA. He expressed concern that overexposure at an early age could cause later behavioral and neurological symptoms. <br /><br />Wal-Mart, the world''s largest retailer, announced on Thursday it plans to offer more BPA-free products and intends to stop selling baby bottles made with BPA early next year. <br /><br />Rochester, New York-based bottle maker Nalgene said on Friday it will phase out production of bottles made with BPA. Nalgene is owned by Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. <br /><br />U.S. states including California, Maryland, Minnesota and Michigan are considering bills to ban or restrict bisphenol A in children''s products. <br /><br />In Washington, Democratic Reps.

The students were also asked if they had ever suffered various broad categories of trauma -- such as violent trauma, sexual trauma or the death of a loved one -- and had them rate how severely they had been affected the event. <br /><br />The subjects were between 18 and 19 years old, 55 percent were female and most - 96.3 percent - were Caucasian. Over the course of the study, 30 students dropped out. <br /><br />The researchers found that students with a history of trauma -- ranging from the divorce of their parents, to the death of a loved one, to physical or sexual abuse -- were more likely to have symptoms of an eating disorder. <br /><br />Students who, for example, said they''d suffered a "violent trauma" in the past were more likely than their peers to skip meals, fast, binge-eat or abuse diet pills or laxatives. Bingeing, laxative abuse and vomiting were also more common among students who said they''d been traumatized by divorce or the death of someone they loved. <br /><br />Previous studies have found that victims of childhood sexual abuse are at increased risk of bulimia and, to a lesser extent, anorexia. <br /><br />The current findings suggest that a range of childhood traumas may contribute to eating disorder risk, according to the researchers, led by Dr. Joshua M. Smyth, an associate professor of psychology at Syracuse University in New York. <br /><br />They report the results in the International Journal of Eating Disorders. <br /><br />Overall, Smyth''s team found, students with a history of childhood trauma were both more likely to already have eating-related problems and more likely to develop new problems over the course of the semester. <br /><br />The findings have implications for screening and prevention of eating disorders in college, according to the researchers.

"One fascinating fact," Levanon highlighted, "is that when you diagnose ovarian cancer you find massive invasive tumors on the surface of the ovary -- usually the tumor does not invade the ovary -- but you never find early pre-invasive in situ tumors." <br /><br />"We do not believe that these invasive tumors arise as invasive cancers," she said, adding that "the foundation of our research is to look for precursor lesions." Precursor lesions are clusters of irregular cells representing the stage just before the formation of cancer cells -- in this case, ovarian cancer cells. <br /><br />Levanon and colleagues studied a group of women at very high risk for ovarian cancer due to family history who underwent removal of their fallopian tubes and ovaries as a preventive measure. <br /><br />When these women were closely evaluated, the researchers found that they had early cancerous growths -- and these early growths were in the fallopian tube, not on the surface of the ovary, Levanon said. <br /><br />"Even more surprisingly," she said, the growths were confined to a particular area within the fallopian tube called the fimbria, which is located close to the ovary. <br /><br />Levanon said these early precursor cell clusters were in "close to 100 percent" of the fallopian tubes in a group of women who already had ovarian cancer. <br /><br />These data, the researcher said, "support our hypothesis that ovarian cancer originates in the fallopian tube and exfoliates or falls over the surface of the ovary and that''s why these tumors develop on the surface of the ovary and not inside the ovary." <br /><br />She hopes these data help in the design of future studies aimed at gaining a greater understanding of the basic process involved in the origin and growth of serous ovarian carcinoma, which could lead to targeted therapies and perhaps prevention strategies.', '', 1, 12, 0, 26, '2008-04-23 22:03:03', 62, '', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 0, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2008-04-23 22:03:03', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', '', 'show_title=\nlink_titles=\nshow_intro=\nshow_section=\nlink_section=\nshow_category=\nlink_category=\nshow_vote=\nshow_author=\nshow_create_date=\nshow_modify_date=\nshow_pdf_icon=\nshow_print_icon=\nshow_email_icon=\nlanguage=\nkeyref=\nreadmore=', 1, 0, 5, '', '', 0, 2, 'robots=\nauthor='),

Anne Walshaw and colleagues note. <br /><br />"Such advice is not backed up by evidence-based lactation physiology," Walshaw, of Bradford and Airedale Teaching Primary Care Trust, in Bradford, told Reuters Health. <br /><br />After noticing poor weight gain among breast-fed babies after baby-led breast-feeding became more common, Walshaw and colleagues compared early weight gain in infants who were exclusively breast fed. Thirty one healthy mother/baby pairs followed the baby-led advice and a similar group of 32 mother/baby pairs followed the traditional breast-feeding advice. <br /><br />The traditional breast-feeding approach involves breast-feeding using both breasts at each feeding for no more than 10 minutes per breast. <br /><br />They found that infants were more likely to be exclusively breast-fed for up to 12 weeks when their mothers followed traditional rather than baby-led breast-feeding practices. <br /><br />Furthermore, feeding more than 10 minutes from the first breast was associated with poor weight gain during the first 6 to 8 weeks of exclusive breast-feeding, the researchers report in the Archives of Disease in Childhood. <br /><br />Traditional methods take advantage of the physiological mechanisms of breast-feeding, Walshaw said. The regular, short-term use of both breasts at each feeding conditions the let-down reflex. Moreover, draining milk from both breasts at each feeding inhibits the slowing of milk production in an unused breast, and takes advantage of the higher fat and protein content of early-released milk from each breast. <br /><br />By contrast, baby-led breast-feeding can decondition the let-down reflex through prolonged suckling at each feed, and can gradually enhance lesser milk production by using only one breast at each feeding. <br /><br />Walshaw and colleagues conclude that strategies encouraging breast feeding must heed lactation physiology. <br /><br />SOURCE: Archives of Disease in Childhood, April 2008', '', 1, 12, 0, 26, '2008-04-23 22:03:28', 62, '', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 0, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2008-04-23 22:03:28', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', '', 'show_title=\nlink_titles=\nshow_intro=\nshow_section=\nlink_section=\nshow_category=\nlink_category=\nshow_vote=\nshow_author=\nshow_create_date=\nshow_modify_date=\nshow_pdf_icon=\nshow_print_icon=\nshow_email_icon=\nlanguage=\nkeyref=\nreadmore=', 1, 0, 4, '', '', 0, 2, 'robots=\nauthor='),

Most of the houses are standing. No one has died. The trees are not even decapitated, as they are in so many hamlets swallowed by the storm.<br /><br />Women hung onto one another as they stood in line for food aid. Millions of Bangladeshis are in dire need of clean water, food and shelter after the cyclone. <br /><br />But in this part of the world, where life revolves around water, look more closely and see how the storm has fouled so much of everyday life. Rice fields are waterlogged. Shrimp ponds have rotted. Women worry what their children will drink once their pots of rainwater run out. Not enough water, too much water, dirty water. Water bedevils everyone.<br /><br />Aid began to trickle in across the cyclone zone on Wednesday, nearly a week after the storm. In this village, a long line of supplicants received sacks of rice, lentils and salt, and the country’s neighbors, allies and rivals seemed to fall over themselves to offer charity and succor.<br /><br />Pakistan, the country’s former ruler, which Bangladesh fought a bitter war of independence against in 1971, announced that it would send two military planes full of medical supplies and blankets. India said that an air force cargo plane would arrive Thursday with 38 tons of aid.<br /><br />Two United States Navy vessels were en route and expected to arrive with helicopters within days. Saudi Arabia pledged $100 million early this week, the largest amount, until the World Bank offered $250 million on Wednesday. Whether and how soon the pledged support will materialize is a mystery.<br /><br />Neither the government nor aid agencies had an estimate on how much money was necessary to meet the humanitarian need, but a World Food Program assessment found that $30 million would be required for food just for the next three months. The United Nations resident representative for Bangladesh, Renata Lok Dessalien, said food, water and shelter were the immediate needs, and were all the more acute for cyclone victims who were already poor, likely to be malnourished and vulnerable to disease.<br /><br />Cyclone Sidr cut a wide and debilitating swath through southern Bangladesh. The government estimates that four million people have been affected, and the full scope of its impact may not be felt for many weeks. By the Bangladeshi Army’s latest count, 3,167 people have died.<br /><br />In Kanainagar, near Dhaka, the capital, Sunita Mondol, 15, was feeling the cyclone’s toll. She stood at the side of her family’s pond Wednesday morning and found no more than two tiny shrimps clinging to her net. On a normal morning, she would haul in a full basket and take it to the market to sell. <br /><br />But the storm had spoiled the pond, shaking the leaves and branches from the trees and fouling the water, so much that the shrimps died and floated belly up. On the first morning after the storm, Sunita and her family pulled up more than 13 pounds of dead fish. They threw most away.<br /><br />Families like hers, who make their living from selling the fish and shrimps they cultivate in their ponds, expect to feel the economic pinch of the cyclone for months. Every family in this village has a small pond, and family after family complained of theirs having been fouled.<br /><br />Half of the fish in Pinjira Begum’s two big ponds floated belly up, which meant that her daily earnings plummeted by nearly half. The moneylender came to her home last Saturday for his weekly payment. “We told him we didn’t have money to buy rice for the children,” she said. She gave him half of what she owed. He cursed her and left.<br /><br />Southern Bangladesh is one of the world’s most productive shrimp hubs. Shrimp is one of the country’s largest exports to the United States.<br /><br />The lucky ones here had rainwater left in their traditional earthen pots. Those whose water had run out, or whose pots had broken, had to drink the pond water, which had turned salty from seawater and had begun to stink from putrefying leaves.<br /><br />A rickshaw puller down the road wondered aloud how long it would be until dysentery struck. Even without a cyclone, he said, water brings a constant specter of disease. <br /><br />In the hot months, when the rainwater stores run out and the ponds start drying up, the people of Kanainagar suffer rashes, dysentery and diarrhea. The cyclone made a chronic concern potentially acute. <br /><br />“Water is our main problem,” said Alamgir Hossain. “People get too sick to work, and still they have to buy medicine.”<br /><br />Across the Mongla River, Muhammad Nantu Mian worked feverishly to salvage what the water had not wrecked. His rice field was flooded, just two weeks before the harvest was due. The stalks were blown down like scarecrows by the brute wind. He had drained some of the water by cutting channels in his fields. He hired workers to cut what rice stalks had not yet rotted. He figured a third of his crop was gone.<br /><br />Normally, Mr. Mian said, he sold half of what he produced, saving the rest for his own family and for next year’s seeds. This year, he said, he could reasonably hope to be able to feed his family, and not much more.', '', 1, 2, 0, 10, '2008-04-24 23:26:55', 62, '', '2008-04-24 23:39:15', 62, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2008-04-24 23:26:55', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', '', 'show_title=\nlink_titles=\nshow_intro=\nshow_section=\nlink_section=\nshow_category=\nlink_category=\nshow_vote=\nshow_author=\nshow_create_date=\nshow_modify_date=\nshow_pdf_icon=\nshow_print_icon=\nshow_email_icon=\nlanguage=\nkeyref=\nreadmore=', 3, 0, 12, '', '', 0, 11, 'robots=\nauthor='),

The river swelled above the tree line. And in a flash, Mamataz Begum’s youngest child, barely 2 years old, was swept from her arms, as a tidal wave smashed through the fragile mud homes of this village and scooped up everything in its watery arms.<br /><br />Children stood amid the wreckage of their destroyed village of Khatachira on Tuesday. More Photos &gt; <br /><br />In this hamlet on the southernmost fringe of Bangladesh, cut by rivers that empty into the Bay of Bengal, nothing was spared by the cyclone that ripped through here last Thursday. Barely a single house was standing; they were all made of mud and they simply collapsed into the earth. The meager food stocks of the village had washed away. Fishing boats and nets, a principal source of income here, were gone. The paddies had filled up with brackish water, which meant there would be no harvest. <br /><br />On Tuesday, animal carcasses, stinking and bloated, lay scattered along the river bank. There was no drinking water left. A small bag of food from the government, the sole aid so far for this village of about 1,000 families, had run out. <br /><br />The people of Khatachira are a testament to the bittersweet blessings of the latest natural calamity to befall Bangladesh. Relatively speaking, the death toll from the cyclone was small — some 3,167 according to the latest official count, roughly double the death toll of Hurricane Katrina but far less than the 140,000 killed in 1991 after the last cyclone hit Bangladesh. In large measure, that was because of an early warning system that had announced the storm and had urged people to head to shelters. <br /><br />But in claiming relatively few lives, it left many more people in utter ruin. The government estimates that about four million people have been affected.<br /><br />“The crisis is just beginning,” said Suman Islam, humanitarian assistance coordinator with the aid agency Care, which had sent its first relief assessment team here Tuesday afternoon. “We have saved lives. But now, the challenge is the same.”<br /><br />In Khatachira, near the edge of the Sunderbans, the world’s largest mangrove forest, villagers have so far buried 57 of their own, nearly half of them children under age 10. Many probably died because they could not swim or cling to trees. On Tuesday morning another body, that of a local woman, was found in the bush of a neighboring village; she had yet to be brought home for burial. All but seven people had been accounted for. <br /><br />An old man who lost his entire family was searching for the bodies of his two grandchildren. Another old man said his granddaughter, age 8, was still missing. A woman with a hideous gash on her right foot — from a piece of tin roofing that fell and sliced her skin — said four in her family had been killed, and five were left to carry on. <br /><br />The nearest cyclone shelter was about two and a half miles away, and it had swelled well past capacity by the time most people in this village were ready to evacuate. One woman even went to the shelter, went home after it seemed that the storm was not coming, and was killed. <br /><br />“See over there, that was our house,” said Muhammad Himayat, pointing at an open stretch of paddy. The house is gone, along with two dozen goats, two cows and three fishing boats that together were the family’s livelihood. “It is all river now.”<br /><br />This is what the villagers said among themselves:<br /><br />“Where’s Salem?” one man asked.<br /><br />“He lost his son,” someone responded.<br /><br />“Has the grandson been found?”<br /><br />“No.”<br /><br />Scientists studying climate change in this part of the world say they expect extreme weather, including cyclones and powerful tropical storms, to rise in frequency here. And the United Nations has increasingly warned of the high toll these disasters exact on the poor.<br /><br />The survivors of Cyclone Sidr are among the poorest of the poorest, in one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world. <br /><br />Dysentery was the next demon that aid workers were guarding against. In this watery land, clean drinking water is in short supply. There are only a few water wells. The ponds, from which many villagers get their drinking water, are contaminated with rotting leaves and animals. Toilets are rare, and the practice of defecating in the fields makes it much easier for disease to spread. <br /><br />The government has appealed for international aid and in a rare gesture, opened its visa gates to foreigners, including journalists. Officials said relief workers and the military had reached the last remaining pockets of the devastated areas on Tuesday, Reuters reported.<br /><br />But food supplies remained woefully inadequate. “Hundreds of hands go up to grab just one food packet,” said a relief worker in the Patuakhali district.<br /><br />Donor countries have pledged $142 million in emergency aid. The United Nations World Food Program has distributed nearly 100 tons of high-energy biscuits and was to begin delivering rice on Friday. The United States has offered two C-130 transport planes and two amphibious naval vessels with helicopters. <br /><br />But delivering aid to places like Khatachira is not easy. Getting here means a long drive, crossing a narrow river whose only ferry has been destroyed, driving through a fetid market town that smells of dead flesh and taking a two-hour boat ride along the Baleshwar River, afloat with dead goats and ducks. <br /><br />Along the journey, one can see evidence of life limping back. A village government office, relatively untouched, has placed its documents on the front porch to dry. A remote college had its roof and walls blown off, but someone has neatly arranged the desks. The roads had been cleared of fallen logs. Banana trees and palms lay crumpled, like victims of an all-night brawl. <br /><br />The day after the cyclone, villagers here had hoisted red flags at the edge of the hamlet. Aid workers had been slow to arrive but those who had were besieged by villagers, who knew that only in narrating their losses could they expect to gain anything. <br /><br />On the edge of the water, near a tree whose roots were barely hanging onto the earth, stood a couple of cooking pots — remnants of Mamataz Begum’s kitchen. Her son’s body had washed up in another village, and they brought his corpse here. Her other children survived. Her husband broke his leg as he swam through the waves. <br /><br />On Tuesday, she was still dazed, and had no idea where the family’s next meal would come from. <br /><br />“If God will feed us, we will eat,” she said.', '', 1, 2, 0, 10, '2008-04-24 23:39:26', 62, '', '2008-04-24 23:45:04', 62, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2008-04-24 23:39:26', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', '', 'show_title=\nlink_titles=\nshow_intro=\nshow_section=\nlink_section=\nshow_category=\nlink_category=\nshow_vote=\nshow_author=\nshow_create_date=\nshow_modify_date=\nshow_pdf_icon=\nshow_print_icon=\nshow_email_icon=\nlanguage=\nkeyref=\nreadmore=', 2, 0, 11, '', '', 0, 14, 'robots=\nauthor='),

Usha Mishra, a senior adviser at the United Nations World Food Program, said food supplies had been severely disrupted, creating a risk of famine.<br /><br />She said the program had begun to distribute food and that more serious emergency operations were being considered, including broader food distribution and rebuilding of homes. “Shelter is the big need right now,” she said. “One million people have been turned homeless.”<br /><br />The government’s officially confirmed death toll from the cyclone reached 3,113, said Lt.

In the long term, the cells may be useful in developing new ways to repair damaged hearts following a heart attack. <br /><br />The study marks the latest step toward possibly using embryonic stem cells -- master cells that can transform into all types of cells in the body -- to treat disease in people. <br /><br />Canadian, US and British scientists said they succeeded in the laboratory in directing human embryonic stem cells to turn into the most immature possible heart cell in human development. This cell is called a heart progenitor cell. <br /><br />The scientists then encouraged these cells to develop into three types of human heart cells: cardiomyocytes, which are cardiac muscle cells that contract with the beating heart; and two other types called endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells that make the blood vessels in the heart. <br /><br />When the scientists transplanted the three types into mice with simulated heart disease, their heart function was improved, offering hope to researchers who may want to develop this technique for treating human hearts. <br /><br />"We''re not the first group to show that you can make heart cells from embryonic stem cells.

Political leaders and private service holders will be able to contest the local government polls. <br /><br />The Local Government (City Corporation) Ordinance 2008 and Local Government (Municipalities) Ordinance 2008 kept a provision for a ban on the war criminals convicted by any local or international court or tribunal, the chief adviser''s press secretary Syed Fahim Munaim told reporters after a cabinet meeting. <br /><br />The council of advisers held the meeting at the Chief Adviser''s Office, chaired by CA Fakhruddin Ahmed. <br /><br />The ordinances were designed in line with the recommendations of a committee the government formed last year to strengthen local government bodies. Adviser AMM Shawkat Ali led the seven-member committee. <br /><br />The ordinance related to city corporations will bring all city corporations under the same law.

(113, 'Goodbye to Cuban embargo?', 'goodbye-to-cuban-embargo', '', 'COLUMN   \r\nBernd Debusmann   \r\n   \r\nWASHINGTON, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - If votes in the United Nations serve as a gauge of global opinion, 98.9 percent of the world opposes the U.S. trade embargo on Cuba, a measure imposed 46 years ago to isolate the communist-ruled island and bring down its leaders. ', '  \r\n   \r\nIt failed on both counts. As far as international opinion is concerned, the country that is isolated is the United States, not Cuba. In the latest of 17 successive U.N. General Assembly resolutions on lifting the embargo, Washington mustered only two allies — Israel and Palau, a Pacific island nation difficult to find on a map. It has a population of 21,000.   \r\n   \r\nThe Marshall Islands (pop. 63,000), which had voted with the United States from 2000 to 2007, unexpectedly and without public explanation broke ranks this year and abstained in the vote, a non-binding resolution taken a week before the U.S. presidential election.   \r\n   \r\nThe count — 185 countries in favor of lifting the embargo, three against — speaks volumes about a bankrupt policy stuck in the Cold War era.   \r\n   \r\nWill that kind of America versus the world line-up change under Barack Obama? Not necessarily. The man who made history on Nov. 4 by becoming the first black to be elected president of the United States has promised to "ease" sanctions if Cuba took "significant steps toward democracy, beginning with freeing all political prisoners".   \r\n   \r\nHe has not said what it would take for the United States to end the embargo, kept in place by 10 successive U.S. presidents, both Democrats and Republicans.   \r\n   \r\nDuring the Cold War, when Cuba was a heavily-armed outpost of the Soviet empire just 90 miles (145 km) from Florida, a majority of Americans agreed with a hard line on a Communist government that violates human rights and holds political prisoners. That attitude has been changing since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union.   \r\n   \r\nAccording to a Zogby poll taken a week before the election, 60 percent of Americans believe that Washington should revise its policies towards Cuba. In particular, 68 percent thought Americans should be allowed to travel to the island and 62 percent said U.S. companies should be allowed to trade with it.   \r\n   \r\nIf that happens, it won''t be soon.   \r\n   \r\nLatin America in general and Cuba in particular are not likely to figure high on the agenda of a new president who is inheriting two wars and the worst economic crisis since the 1930s. American presidents tend to promise greater attention to southern neighbors but usually do not follow through.   \r\n   \r\n"I''m not so idealistic as to think that the embargo will be lifted immediately," Cuban dissident and writer Jorge Olivera told Reuters Havana correspondent Jeff Franks.   \r\n   \r\n"But I expect better times as much for the United States as for Cuba. I don''t want to die without seeing an end to this conflict that began when I was born."   \r\n   \r\nWorth noting: Under a 1996 law, the president needs congressional approval to lift the embargo or to recognize any government that includes Fidel Castro, who officially stepped down in February, or his brother Raul, who took over from him.   \r\n   \r\nSTATIC AND COUNTER-PRODUCTIVE   \r\n   \r\nIn the past, the most fervent opposition to ending the embargo — the effects of which have punished the population for the actions of a leadership it did not elect — has come from the Cuban-American community in South Florida. But even this is changing.   \r\n   \r\n"U.S. policy towards Cuba is at best static and at worst counter-productive, a source of increasing frustration to many Cuban Americans," Jorge Mas Santos, chairman of the Cuban American National Foundation (CANF), wrote late in October in a Washington Post opinion column that endorsed Obama.   \r\n   \r\nCANF was set up in 1981 by Mas''s father, Jorge Mas Canosa, with the express aim of overthrowing the government of Fidel Castro. For years, the group exerted enormous influence on Washington policy makers — as well as on presidential candidates keenly aware that winning the White House without winning Florida is a very difficult undertaking. Obama won the state comfortably.   \r\n   \r\nCuban exiles, numbering around 650,000, account for just over a quarter of the total population of the greater Miami area. In the past, the Republican Party took the loyalty of most of them for granted — Cuban Americans have traditionally voted four to one for Republicans.   \r\n   \r\nThe three Miami-based Cuban American Republicans who serve in the House of Representatives — all supporters of the embargo — were re-elected. Their votes against changes Obama might propose once he takes office on Jan. 20 can be taken for granted.   \r\n   \r\nSome of the most pointed criticism of the embargo has come not from Democrats but from conservative businessmen who resent the fact that American business has been kept out of Cuba while most of the world is engaged there.   \r\n   \r\nIn the words of Tom Donohue, CEO of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce: "All you have to do is go over to Cuba and watch how the Spanish, the French, the Latin Americans and everybody else on the globe are building resorts or trying to invest, and we are sitting here with a 50-year-old policy that doesn''t work."   \r\n   \r\nThe prime beneficiaries from an end to the embargo would be American agricultural exporters. "But just about every industry could benefit," according to Donohue, "for the simple reason that there is such pent-up demand. Look at the cars they are running — Jack Kennedy was in office when half of them were sent down there."   \r\n   \r\n   \r\n<i>–Bernd Debusmann is a Reuters columnist.

(129, 'Madoff victims could turn to tax code for relief', 'madoff-victims-could-turn-to-tax-code-for-relief', '', 'BOSTON, Dec 20(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A law designed to protect uninsured Americans who lose a television or other valuables to thieves could provide a glimmer of relief for thousands of investors burned by possibly one of Wall Street''s biggest frauds.  \r\n  \r\nInvestors swindled by former Nasdaq Chairman Bernard Madoff''s alleged $50 billion fraud are exploring ways to recoup at least some of their money through so-called "theft loss" deductions or other tax refunds.  \r\n  \r\nThose tax-code features could help shell-shocked investors recover potentially hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars, lawyers and tax advisors say.  \r\n  \r\n"Just from watching the TV, I can see this is a theft," said Robert Willens, a New York tax adviser. "And theft losses are treated much more favorably than most other losses are treated for tax purposes."  \r\n  \r\nTheft-loss provisions were intended to help uninsured people whose property was stolen, damaged or destroyed in an accident or by an act of nature -- from storms to earthquakes.  \r\n  \r\nBut they also apply to fraud-related investments. Taxpayers can deduct theft losses if they exceed 10 percent of their adjusted gross income in the year the fraud was discovered, which is 2008. Given the massive scale of fraud, losses for many of Madoff''s investors could top the 10 percent threshold.  \r\n  \r\nThose deductions can be made on income taxes dating to 2005. And any unused losses can be used to reduce tax liabilities for the next 20 years, said Warren Kessler, an attorney at the Los Angeles law firm Kessler & Kessler.  \r\n  \r\n"There is no question that it applies in this context. It''s pretty clear that this is a theft loss," he said.  \r\n  \r\nThere are important caveats: In order to claim the deduction, it has to be a reasonable chance an investor will not recoup their losses. That means those who pursue class- action lawsuits may be ineligible.  \r\n  \r\nIt could also make deductions off limits to those who lost money through so-called feeder funds, or hedge funds set up by outside investment advisory firms that marketed Madoff''s investments to high net-worth individuals and pension funds.  \r\n  \r\nExceptions also include charities and pension funds that were tax-exempt. And investors in Madoff''s business who are compensated by the government-sponsored Securities Investor Protection Corp may have trouble getting deductions.  \r\n  \r\n"LIKE A MINI-BAILOUT"  \r\n  \r\nBut for those who are eligible, the money could be big.  \r\n  \r\nAn individual investor who lost $100 million, for example, may be able to recoup $35 million through a deduction against ordinary income, usually taxed for wealthy investors at the top rate of 35 percent, tax lawyers say.  \r\n  \r\n"If the size of Madoff''s fraud is $50 billion, let''s say individuals are half of that, or $25 billion. For federal tax purposes they will get back 35 percent, or nearly $9 billion. That''s like a mini-bailout," Kessler said.  \r\n  \r\nJohn Barrie, a tax partner at the New York law firm Bryan Cave LLP, sees other tax implications because of the nature of Ponzi schemes, which pay off old investors with money from new ones and rely on a constant stream of new investment.  \r\n  \r\nMadoff, 70, is accused of defrauding banks, charities and rich individuals through a long-running Ponzi scheme executed at Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, which he launched in 1960.  \r\n  \r\nMany of Madoff''s investors should be able to seek refunds on capital-gains taxes paid for 2005 through 2007.  \r\n  \r\n"They would have paid taxes on things that were never there. They should file amended returns to restate their returns going back three years to eliminate that income," Barrie said, noting the refund is limited to three years.  \r\n  \r\n"Those that have been there a long time are stuck with what they have on their returns."  \r\n  \r\nMark Robyn, an analyst at the Tax Foundation, a nonprofit research group in Washington, expected many of those burned by Madoff to seek relief through the U.S. tax code.  \r\n  \r\n"It seems like something that most investors will be able to take advantage of," he said.  \r\n  \r\nIt is unclear, however, whether the Internal Revenue Service will allow Madoff''s investors to use theft-loss rules. The agency has kept quiet on the issue.  \r\n  \r\n"We are aware of the situation, but beyond that we have no comment," said IRS spokesman Bruce Friedland.  \r\n  \r\nWillens said many investors may be better served by pursuing tax refunds instead of litigation, which could drag on for years.  \r\n  \r\n"My advice is to not file a claim for reimbursement and instead take the loss right away and you''ll recoup 35 percent of it through tax refunds," he added.  \r\n  \r\nbdnews24.com/mhb/1337 hrs.', '', 1, 5, 0, 13, '2008-12-21 07:18:36', 67, '', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 0, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2008-12-21 07:18:36', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', '', 'show_title=\nlink_titles=\nshow_intro=\nshow_section=\nlink_section=\nshow_category=\nlink_category=\nshow_vote=\nshow_author=\nshow_create_date=\nshow_modify_date=\nshow_pdf_icon=\nshow_print_icon=\nshow_email_icon=\nlanguage=\nkeyref=\nreadmore=', 1, 0, 1, '', '', 0, 0, 'robots=\nauthor='),

Sylvester Stallone, Bruce Willis and Arnie tackled problems with big guns, big muscles and big egos. There was a clear division between good and evil, and machismo conquered all.\r\n\r\nThese days, the tough guy persona is giving way to more multifaceted characters.

They will finish their work, then go," said the Indian high commissioner. <br /><br />He said the vessels were Jamaican survey ships chartered by private companies that secured licenses from the Indian government. <br /><br />The foreign secretary also said that there were no Indian navy ships in the disputed area "at this moment", although in a statement on Friday the foreign ministry said two Indian naval ships were in disputed waters, some 140 nautical miles off Mongla port. <br /><br />"I have requested the high commissioner so that India removes its ships," Touhid Hossain told reporters at his office Saturday.

I''m begging apology if there had been any mistakes during our tenure.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n', '\r\n<br />"We want to have a new start if we are voted to power," the two-time prime minister said at a huge elelction rally at Paltan in the capital.</p>\r\n<p>Indicating former military ruler Jatiya Party chief HM Ershad, a key ally of the Awami League-led grand alliance, Khaleda said, "They have formed a grand alliance with a great thief." <br /><br />Firing barbs at the rival alliance, Khaleda alleged they had foiled the planned Jan. 22, 2007 election by creating anarchy being sure of her alliance assuming office once again. <br /><br />"The great thief had dislodged democracy. He was convicted for graft charges in normal court. Still there are cases against him," Khaleda remarked. <br /><br />"The country will not get back democracy through them, neither will they eliminate corruption." <br /><br />"Promises of fight against corruption do not go with them. They had patronised godfathers inthe districts. You all know about the godfathers in Dhaka, Naraynganj and Feni districts, who caused sufferings to the people." <br /><br />She said Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina had connived with autocratic ruler Ershad in 1986. <br /><br />Hasina at a Chittagong rally had declared that any connivance with Ershad would amount to betraying the nation, and yet, she had gone to the election within 24 hours of the declaration, Khaleda said. <br /><br />Khaleda contested ''grand allaince'' chief Sheikh Hasina''s claim that she had been charged with graft for buying MiG-29 fighter planes and frigates to protect sovereignty of the country. <br /><br />"Old and reconditioned MiG-29 planes and frigates were bought for the country with a higher price that caused the government financial losses," she argued. <br /><br />Citing a "special" report, the former prime minister said corruption worth Tk 12, 192 crore was reported in the year 2000 during AL rule. <br /><br />The BNP government had reduced it to Tk 4,391 crore, Khaleda claimed, adding in 2005, her government had further reduced it to 526 crore. <br /><br />She promised efforts to fight off corruption and terrorism. <br /><br />"The Anticorruption Commission will work independently, without any government interference. No-one will compromise in preventing militancy." <br /><br />Khaleda alleged the AL had created anarchy in education sector and curbed freedom of the media and judiciary. <br /><br />"But we had clamed down on cheating in the examinations," she claimed. <br /><br />Despite ''repression on her family and conspiracy to split BNP'', the BNP chief said, she did not leave the country, but ''many'' fled danger. <br /><br />"Now we want to forget all differences and work together for the country. We will forget the past and move forward. <br /><br />"So we need to put an end to hartal, strike, and vandalism, as the people do not want any politics of conflict." <br /><br />She promised female students free eduction up to undergraduate level and better living standard for the people, if elected to form government. <br /><br />To the young voters, she said, "As a mother, I''m promising you if you vote us to the power again, we''ll work for your happy future." <br /><br />"You are the future of the country, We don''t have time to look back, we''ll have to march forward." <br /><br />She introduced party candidates for the 19 constituencies in Dhaka to the audience and sought vote for them. <br /><br />"The people of the country have risen today. Create history by voting for the four-party alliance on Dec. 29. And thus save the country and save yourselves as well." <br /><br />Khaleda said the four-party alliance needed to get back to power again for continuing the development in education, health, women and job sectors. <br /><br />Khaleda wished the nation a happy new year. <br /><br />"We''ll see a new year only after four days. On the eve of the new year, I wish the people of the country can work freely with an elected government." <br /><br />She started addressing the vast public rally amid tight security, behind a bulletproof glass screen. <br /><br />The Awami League president Sheikh Hasina gave her address at the same spot just the day before. <br /><br />People were allowed to enter through the main gate, the only gate between Bangabandhu National Sadium and Moulana Bhashani Hockey Stadium. <br /><br />They had to go through several check points to enter there. <br /><br />The security forces deployed patrol team in the surrounding buildings. <br /><br />The banner in the stage reads ''save the country, save the people for the sake of democracy and development.'' <br /><br />One side of the banner shows the image of former president Ziaur Rahman, the party founder, and the other side Khaleda. <br /><br />Party supporters started arriving in the venue since morning with processions from different areas. The gathering formally started at around 3:15 pm through reading out religious text. <br /><br />Security set-up at Paltan has been beefed up specially in view of the two party bosses holding public meetings on two consecutive days. <br /><br />Khaleda, like Hasina, is addressing public meetings at the venue for the first time since 2006. <br /><br />She began her election campaign on Dec. 12 through visiting Shah Jalal''s shrine in Sylhet. <br /><br />She has since been touring the country and speaking to people and seeking their votes. <br /><br />bdnews24.com/sm/su/khk/1527hours</p>', 1, 15, 0, 29, '2008-12-26 11:00:00', 62, '', '2009-01-02 17:28:44', 62, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2008-12-26 11:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', '', 'show_title=\nlink_titles=\nshow_intro=\nshow_section=\nlink_section=\nshow_category=\nlink_category=\nshow_vote=\nshow_author=\nshow_create_date=\nshow_modify_date=\nshow_pdf_icon=\nshow_print_icon=\nshow_email_icon=\nlanguage=\nkeyref=\nreadmore=', 6, 0, 3, '', '', 0, 2, 'robots=\nauthor='),

But these are survey ships. They will finish their work, then go," said the Indian high commissioner. <br /><br />He said the vessels were Jamaican survey ships chartered by private companies that secured licenses from the Indian government. <br /><br />The foreign secretary also said that there were no Indian navy ships in the disputed area "at this moment", although in a statement on Friday the foreign ministry said two Indian naval ships were in disputed waters, some 140 nautical miles off Mongla port. <br /><br />"I have requested the high commissioner so that India removes its ships," Touhid Hossain told reporters at his office Saturday. Meanwhile, two Bangladesh Navy ships are patrolling the waters, he added. <br /><br />Chakravarty said: "This is not a disputed area. We call it overlapping claims … we have a right, they have a right." <br /><br />"We are keen that a Bangladeshi team go to Delhi to sort out this issue." <br /><br />Replying to a question on whether the Indian ships would remain until the talks, the high commissioner said, "That is the matter for discussion." <br /><br />"Bangladesh has offered this area for international bidding knowing full well there were overlapping claims. When negotiations are on, why did the Bangladesh government put it up for international bidding?" <br /><br />"If we wanted to create tension, we would have done something else," the Indian envoy said laughingly. <br /><br />But, Chakravarty added: "There is no chance of escalating tension. We always talk to each other." <br /><br />Touhid Hossain said: "The high commissioner seemed very positive and I hope the ships will go." <br /><br />"He told me that he would send a note to Delhi for a meeting," he said. <br /><br />bdnews24.com/krc/rah/1410hours </span>', '2008-12-27 09:19:42', 62, 1),

অতীতের এ ভুল থেকে শিক্ষা নিয়ে আমি আগামীতে নতুনভাবে কাজ করে যাবো।" <br /><br />প্রধান প্রতিপক্ষ আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন মহাজোটকে উদ্দেশ করে বিএনপি চেয়ারপারসন খালেদা জিয়া বলেন, "তারা মহাচোরকে নিয়ে মহাজোট করেছে।" <br /><br />তিনি এ প্রসঙ্গে সাবেক স্বৈরশাসক হুসেইন মুহম্মদ এরশাদের তীব্র নিন্দা করেন। <br /><br />নতুন ভোটারদের ধানের শীষের পক্ষে ভোট দেওয়ার আহ্বান জানিয়ে খালেদা বলেন, "আমি মা হিসাবে তোমাদের বলছি, তোমরা ধানের শীষে ভোট দিয়ে আমাদের বিজয়ী করলে একটি সুন্দর ভবিষ্যতের জন্য কাজ করবো। তোমরাই আগামী দিনের ভবিষ্যত। আর পেছনের দিকে তাকানোর সময় নেই। আমাদের সবাইকে সামনে এগিয়ে যেতে হবে।" <br

নিরাপত্তার মধ্যে। মঞ্চে যেখানে খালেদা জিয়া বসেন, তা বুলেট প্র"ফ কাচ দিয়ে ঘিরে রাখা ছিল। শেখ হাসিনাও শুক্রবার পল্টনে বুলেট প্র"ফ কাচ ঘেরা মঞ্চে বক্তৃতা করেন। <br /><br />রাজধানীর বিভিন্ন এলাকা থেকে দুপুর ১২টা থেকেই বিএনপির মিছিল পল্টনে আসতে শুরু করে। ময়দানে সবাইকে ঢুকতে হয় বঙ্গবন্ধু জাতীয় স্টেডিয়াম ও মওলানা ভাসানী হকি স্টেডিয়ামের মধ্যের প্রধান ফটক দিয়ে। সেখানে নিরাপত্তা বাহিনী কয়েকদফা তল্লাশি

প্রতি শুভেচ্ছা এবং দেশ মাতৃকার জন্য শহীদদের প্রতি শ্রদ্ধা নিবেদন করেন খালেদা জিয়া। <br /><br />তিনি বলেন, "২২ জানুয়ারি নির্বাচনে মহাজোট নির্বাচনে জিততে পারবে না বলেই দেশে বিশৃঙ্খলা, অরাজকতা সৃষ্টি করে নির্বাচন বানচাল করা হয়েছিল। তারা বুঝতে পেরেছিল দেশের মানুষ আবার চারদলকে ক্ষমতায় পাঠাবে।" <br /><br />আওয়ামী লীগ সভানেত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সমালোচনা করে খালেদা জিয়া বলেন, "চারদলের বিপক্ষে ১৪ দলকে নিয়ে যখন সাহসে কুলানো যাচ্ছে না তখন মহাচোরকে নিয়ে মহাজোট বানানো হলো। ওই মহাচোর গনতন্ত্র হরণ করেছিল। দুর্নীতির জন্য আদালতে সাজা হয়েছে। ওই সাজা বিশেষ আদালতে হয়নি। সাধারণ আদালতেই হয়েছে। এখনও অনেক মামলা আছে। এদেরকে নিয়ে গণতন্ত্রও আসবে না, দুর্নীতিও দূর হবে না।" <br /><br />মহাজোটের সমালোচনা করে সাবেক এ প্রধানমন্ত্রী বলেন, "তাদের মুখে সন্ত্রাস দূর করার কথা মানায় না। মানুষ দেশে লগি-বৈঠার আন্দোলন দেখেছে। জেলায় জেলায় গডফাদার তৈরি করেছিল।" <br /><br />বিএনপির ৫ বছরের বিগত শাসনামলে ব্যাপক উন্নয়নের দাবি করে শিক্ষা, কৃষি, স্বাস্থ্য, নারী উন্নয়ন, কর্মসংস্থানসহ বিভিন্ন ক্ষেত্রে এর বিবরণ তুলে ধরেন খালেদা জিয়া। <br /><br />সার্বভৌমত্ব রক্ষায় আওয়ামী লীগ সরকারের পদক্ষেপ বিষয়ে হাসিনার বক্তব্য খণ্ডন করে বিএনপি চেয়ারপারসন বলেন, "দেশের জন্য পুরনো ও ভাঙা মিগ ও ফ্রিগেট কেনা হয়েছিল বেশি দামে, কমিশনও নিয়েছিল তারা। এতে সরকারের আর্থিক ক্ষতি হয়েছে।" <br /><br />নাম উল্লেখ না করে বিদেশী একটি প্রতিবেদনের পরিসংখ্যান তুলে ধরে খালেদা জিয়া বলেন, আওয়ামী লীগের শাসনামলে ২০০০ সালে ১৭ হাজার ১৯২ কোটি টাকার দুর্নীতি হয়েছিল। বিএনপি সরকারে আসার পর তা কমে ৪ হাজার ৩৯১ কোটি টাকায় আসে এবং ২০০৫ সালে তা ৫২৬ কোটি টাকায় নামিয়ে আনা হয়। <br /><br />খালেদা জিয়া অঙ্গীকার করেন, জোট ক্ষমতায় গেলে দেশ থেকে দুর্নীতি ও সন্ত্রাস দমনে সব রকম ব্যবস্থা নেওয়া হবে। অতীতের মতো সন্ত্রাস ও জঙ্গি দমনেও কাউকে ছাড় দেওয়া হবে না। <br /><br />আওয়ামী লীগের স্বাধীনতার অব্যবহিত পরের শাসনামলে শিক্ষা ক্ষেত্রে নকলের বিস্তার, অরাজকতা, সংবাদপত্র ও বিচার বিভাগের স্বাধীনতা হরণ ও দুর্ভিক্ষের অভিযোগ তুলে ধরেন খালেদা জিয়া। <br /><br />স্বৈরশাসক এরশাদের শাসনামলে গণতন্ত্র ফিরিয়ে আনতে নিজের ভূমিকা এবং সামরিক শাসকের সঙ্গে শেখ হাসিনার কথিত ''আঁতাতের'' কথা তুলে ধরে বিএনপি চেয়ারপার্সন বলেন, "একটি গণতান্ত্রিক সরকার হটিয়ে সামরিক সরকার যখন ক্ষমতা দখল করে তখন তিনি বলেছিলেন- ''আই অ্যাম নট আনহ্যাপি''। তার কাছে গণতন্ত্র আশা করা যায় না।" <br /><br />দেশের বর্তমান অবস্থার জন্য আওয়ামী লীগকে দায়ী করে বিএনপি নেত্রী বলেন, "২২ জানুয়ারি নির্বাচন হলে আজকের এ অবস্থার সৃষ্টি হতো না। তাদের কারণে দেশ সামাজিক ও রাজনৈতিকভাবে অনেক পিছিয়ে গেছে।" <br /><br />গত দুই বছরে তার ও তার পরিবারের ওপর নির্যাতন এবং বিএনপিকে ধ্বংসে নানা ষড়যন্ত্র হয়েছে বলে দাবি করে বিএনপি চেয়ারপারসন বলেন, "অনেকেই বিপদ দেখে দেশ ছেড়ে পালিয়েছে। কিন্তু আমি নির্যাতনের মধ্যেও দেশের মাটি ও মানুষকে ছেড়ে কোথাও যাইনি। আমি ছিলাম, আছি, থাকবো।" <br /><br />খালেদা জিয়া বলেন, "আপনাদের প্রতি আস্থা ও বিশ্বাস নিয়ে আজ আমি ভোটের দাবি নিয়ে এসেছি। দেশ ও মানুষকে বাঁচাতে চার দলকে ভোট দিন।" <br /><br />নির্বাচিত হলে সবাইকে নিয়ে কাজ করার অঙ্গীকারও করেন খালেদা জিয়া। <br /><br />তিনি বলেন, "আমরা এখন সব ভেদাভেদ ভুলে সম্মিলিতভাবে সবাইকে নিয়ে কাজ করতে চাই। যা হয়ে গেছে ভুলে গিয়ে সামনে এগুতে হবে। তাই দেশের স্বার্থে হরতাল, ধর্মঘট, অবরোধ, জ্বালাও- পোড়াও আন্দোলন বন্ধ করতে হবে। এটা জনগণ চায় না।" <br /><br />বিএনপি চেয়ারপারসন চারদলের পক্ষে ভোট চেয়ে বিএনপির নির্বাচনী প্রতীক ধানের শীষ তুলে ধরেন। এর পর তিনি ঢাকা জেলার ১৭টি আসনের প্রার্থীদের হাতে ধানের শীষ তুলে দেন। <br /><br />বিএনপির দপ্তর সম্পাদক রিজভী আহমেদ বিডিনিউজ টোয়েন্টিফোর ডটকমকে বলেছিলেন, পল্টনের জনসভার পর সন্ধ্যা থেকে খালেদা জিয়া রাজধানীর কয়েকটি আসনে গণসংযোগ করে নির্বাচনী প্রচারণার সমাপ্তি টানবেন। <br /><br />বিধি অনুযায়ী, ২৯ ডিসেম্বর অনুষ্ঠেয় নির্বাচনী প্রচারের শেষ সময় ২৭ ডিসেম্বর (শনিবার) রাত ১২টা। <br /><br />২০০৬ সালের পর এই প্রথম খালেদা জিয়া পল্টনের জনসভায় বক্তব্য রাখলেন। তিনি গত ১২ ডিসেম্বর সিলেটে হজরত শাহজালালের মাজার জিয়ারত করে আনুষ্ঠানিকভাবে নির্বাচনী প্রচার শুরু করেন। <br /><br />কঠোর নিরাপত্তা বলয়: <br /><br />চারদলীয় জোট নেত্রী খালেদা জিয়া ভাষণ দেওয়ার সময় তার সামনের দিক ছাড়া আশপাশে বিশেষ নিরাপত্তা বাহিনী (এসএসএফ) সদস্যরা নিরাপত্তা বেষ্টনী তৈরি করে। মঞ্চের চারপাশে প্রেসিডেন্ট গার্ড রেজিমেন্টের সদস্য মোতায়েন করা হয়। মঞ্চ ও মাঠের বিভিন্ন স্থানে বসানো হয় ক্লোজ সার্কিট ক্যামেরা। তিন স্তরের নিরাপত্তা বেষ্টনীতে পুলিশ ও র‌্যাব সদস্যরা দায়িত্ব পালন করেন। তিনটি গেট দিয়ে চার থেকে পাঁচ বার দেহ তল্লাশি করে পল্টন ময়দানে ঢুকতে দেওয়া হয়। <br /><br />সমাবেশস্থলের চিত্র <br /><br />তখনও খালেদা জিয়া সমাবেশস্থলে আসতে অনেক বাকি। ঘড়ির কাটায় সময় আড়াইটার মতো। এরমধ্যেই আসতে শুরু করে দলীয় নেতাকর্মীরা। ''ধানের শীষ'' স্লোগান দিতে দিতে আসা অনেক মিছিলেই ছিল ঢোল ও নানা বাদ্যযন্ত্র । নিরাপত্তা বলয়ের মধ্যেই কর্মী সমর্থকরা নৃত্যের তালে তালে মিছিল নিয়ে ঢোকে পল্টন ময়দানে। এসব মিছিলে অংশ নেওয়া অনেক কর্মীর হাতে দেখা যায় জিয়াউর রহমান, খালেদা জিয়া ও তারেক রহমানের বড় বড় প্রতিকৃতি। <br /><br />সাড়ে তিনটা বাজতেই কানায় কানায় ভরে ওঠে পল্টন ময়দান। তখনও মানুষ আসছিল। দৈনিক বাংলা মোড়, বায়তুল মোকাররমের উত্তর ও দক্ষিণ গেট, রাজউক এভিনিউ, গুলিস্তান নর্থসাউথ রোড, মুক্তাঙ্গন, তোপখানা রোড, প্রেসক্লাব ও পুরানা পল্টনের আশপাশে সব সড়কে মিছিল এসে সমবেত হলে পুরো এলাকা পরিণত হয় জনসমুদ্রে। <br /><br />তোপখানা রোড থেকে গুলিস্তান.... <br /><br />সমাবেশ ছড়িয়ে পড়েছিল

'608fb87237bed4736a47ac1150344e40', 'Dhaka, Dec 27 (bdnews24.com) – Taking another shot at power, BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia on Saturday basked for people''s forgiveness "if there had been any mistakes'' during her 2001-2006 rule. <br /><br />"We were in power. I''m begging apology if there had been any mistakes during our tenure. <br /><br />"We want to have a new start if we are voted to power," the two-time prime minister said at a huge elelction rally at Paltan in the capital. <br /><br />Indicating former military ruler Jatiya Party chief HM Ershad, a key ally of the Awami League-led grand alliance, Khaleda said, "They have formed a grand alliance with a great thief." <br /><br />Firing barbs at the rival alliance, Khaleda alleged they had foiled the planned Jan. 22, 2007 election by creating anarchy being sure of her alliance assuming office once again. <br /><br />"The great thief had dislodged democracy. He was convicted for graft charges in normal court. Still there are cases against him," Khaleda remarked. <br /><br />"The country will not get back democracy through them, neither will they eliminate corruption." <br /><br />"Promises of fight against corruption do not go with them. They had patronised godfathers inthe districts. You all know about the godfathers in Dhaka, Naraynganj and Feni districts, who caused sufferings to the people." <br /><br />She said Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina had connived with autocratic ruler Ershad in 1986. <br /><br />Hasina at a Chittagong rally had declared that any connivance with Ershad would amount to betraying the nation, and yet, she had gone to the election within 24 hours of the declaration, Khaleda said. <br /><br />Khaleda contested ''grand allaince'' chief Sheikh Hasina''s claim that she had been charged with graft for buying MiG-29 fighter planes and frigates to protect sovereignty of the country. <br /><br />"Old and reconditioned MiG-29 planes and frigates were bought for the country with a higher price that caused the government financial losses," she argued. <br /><br />Citing a "special" report, the former prime minister said corruption worth Tk 12, 192 crore was reported in the year 2000 during AL rule. <br /><br />The BNP government had reduced it to Tk 4,391 crore, Khaleda claimed, adding in 2005, her government had further reduced it to 526 crore. <br /><br />She promised efforts to fight off corruption and terrorism. <br /><br />"The Anticorruption Commission will work independently, without any government interference. No-one will compromise in preventing militancy." <br /><br />Khaleda alleged the AL had created anarchy in education sector and curbed freedom of the media and judiciary. <br /><br />"But we had clamed down on cheating in the examinations," she claimed. <br /><br />Despite ''repression on her family and conspiracy to split BNP'', the BNP chief said, she did not leave the country, but ''many'' fled danger. <br /><br />"Now we want to forget all differences and work together for the country. We will forget the past and move forward. <br /><br />"So we need to put an end to hartal, strike, and vandalism, as the people do not want any politics of conflict." <br /><br />She promised female students free eduction up to undergraduate level and better living standard for the people, if elected to form government. <br /><br />To the young voters, she said, "As a mother, I''m promising you if you vote us to the power again, we''ll work for your happy future." <br /><br />"You are the future of the country, We don''t have time to look back, we''ll have to march forward." <br /><br />She introduced party candidates for the 19 constituencies in Dhaka to the audience and sought vote for them. <br /><br />"The people of the country have risen today. Create history by voting for the four-party alliance on Dec. 29. And thus save the country and save yourselves as well." <br /><br />Khaleda said the four-party alliance needed to get back to power again for continuing the development in education, health, women and job sectors. <br /><br />Khaleda wished the nation a happy new year. <br /><br />"We''ll see a new year only after four days. On the eve of the new year, I wish the people of the country can work freely with an elected government." <br /><br />She started addressing the vast public rally amid tight security, behind a bulletproof glass screen. <br /><br />The Awami League president Sheikh Hasina gave her address at the same spot just the day before. <br /><br />People were allowed to enter through the main gate, the only gate between Bangabandhu National Sadium and Moulana Bhashani Hockey Stadium. <br /><br />They had to go through several check points to enter there. <br /><br />The security forces deployed patrol team in the surrounding buildings. <br /><br />The banner in the stage reads ''save the country, save the people for the sake of democracy and development.'' <br /><br />One side of the banner shows the image of former president Ziaur Rahman, the party founder, and the other side Khaleda. <br /><br />Party supporters started arriving in the venue since morning with processions from different areas. The gathering formally started at around 3:15 pm through reading out religious text. <br /><br />Security set-up at Paltan has been beefed up specially in view of the two party bosses holding public meetings on two consecutive days. <br /><br />Khaleda, like Hasina, is addressing public meetings at the venue for the first time since 2006. <br /><br />She began her election campaign on Dec. 12 through visiting Shah Jalal''s shrine in Sylhet. <br /><br />She has since been touring the country and speaking to people and seeking their votes. <br /><br />bdnews24.com/sm/su/khk/1527hours', '2008-12-27 09:25:54', 62, 1),

উপলক্ষে শনিবার জাতির উদ্দেশে দেওয়া ভাষণে তিনি বলেন, "উন্নয়নের সুবিশাল কর্মযজ্ঞে আমাদের কিছু ভুলভ্রান্তিও হয়েছিল। আমরা সেই সব ভুলভ্রান্তির জন্য আন্তরিক দুঃখ প্রকাশ করছি এবং আশা করছি আপনারা আমাদের ব্যর্থতা ও ভুলত্র"টিগুলো ক্ষমার চোখে দেখবেন। <br /><br />"আপনাদের বিশ্বাস করতে অনুরোধ করছি যে, অতীতের ওইসব ভুলভ্রান্তি থেকে আমরা শিক্ষা নিয়েছি।" <br /><br />রাত সোয়া ৯টায় বাংলাদেশ টেলিভিশন (বিটিভি) খালেদা জিয়ার এই ভাষণ প্রচার করে। ভাষণটি বিটিভিতে আগেই ধারণ করা হয়। <br /><br />চারদলীয় জোট নেত্রী বলেন, "নির্বাচিত হলে বিএনপি সরকারের প্রথম কাজটি হবে নিত্য প্রয়োজনীয় জিনিসপত্রের দাম বৃদ্ধি রোধ করে, তা দ্রুত কমিয়ে আনা। খাদ্য উৎপাদন বৃদ্ধি করে এবং প্রয়োজনে ভর্তুকি দিয়ে কৃষিপণ্য উৎপাদনের খরচ কমিয়ে, দ্রুত চাল, ডাল, আটা ও ভোজ্য তেলসহ নিত্য প্রয়োজনীয় ভোগ্যপণ্যের দাম কমিয়ে সাধারণ মানুষের কেনার ক্ষমতার মধ্যে নিয়ে আসা। <br /><br />"আজ আমি দৃঢ় অঙ্গীকার করছি যে আগামীতে ক্ষমতায় গেলে অবশ্যই কঠোরভাবে দুর্নীতি ও সন্ত্রাস দমন করব। দুর্নীতিবাজ ও সন্ত্রাসী যেই হোন না কেন, কাউকে ছাড় দেয়া হবে না।" <br /><br />সংসদকে কার্যকর করার জন্য প্রয়োজনীয় ব্যবস্থা নেওয়ার প্রতিশ্র"তি দিয়ে খালেদা বলেন, "নির্বাচনী ইশতেহারে আমরা ঘোষণা করেছি যে, বিরোধী দল থেকে ডেপুটি স্পীকার নির্বাচন করা হবে। নির্বাচিত স্পীকার ও ডেপুটি স্পীকার দায়িত্ব গ্রহণের সঙ্গে সঙ্গে তাদের স্ব স্ব দল থেকে পদত্যাগ করে পুরোপুরি নিরপেক্ষ হয়ে যাবেন। আমরা সংসদীয় স্থায়ী কমিটিতে চেয়ারম্যান পদে সংখ্যাগরিষ্ঠ দলের পাশাপাশি বিরোধী দলের সদস্যও নির্বাচিত করব। <br /><br />"আমরা নির্বাচিত হলে ওয়ারেন্ট অফ প্রেসিডেন্স সংশোধন করে প্রধানমন্ত্রীর পরেই এবং সব মন্ত্রীর ওপরে, বিরোধী দলীয় নেতার অবস্থান ও মর্যাদা নির্ধারণ করব। জাতীয় গুরুত্বপূর্ণ ইস্যুতে বিরোধী দলীয় নেতার মতামত ও পরামর্শ গ্রহণের মাধ্যমে জাতীয় ঐক্যমত গড়ে তোলার উদ্যোগ নেব। সংসদের ভিতরে-বাইরে আলোচনা করে এই উদ্যোগ বাস্তবায়নের চেষ্টা করব।" <br /><br />বিগত সময়ে বিএনপি সরকারই দেশের প্রচার মাধ্যমের স্বাধীনতাকে অবারিত করেছে দাবি করে খালেদা অভিযোগ করেন, "দুর্ভাগ্যজনকভাবে আমাদের প্রতি প্রচার মাধ্যমের সমর্থন ও সহযোগিতা খুবই কম। বরং রয়েছে সীমাহীন অপপ্রচার।" <br /><br />বিএনপি চেয়ারপার্সন বলেন, "আপনারা জানেন, নবম জাতীয় সংসদ নির্বাচন হওয়ার কথা ছিল আজ থেকে প্রায় দুই বছর আগে ২২ জানুয়ারি ২০০৭-এ। কিন্তু নির্ধারিত সময়ে সেই নির্বাচনটি হতে পারেনি। বহু উৎকণ্ঠা, অনিশ্চয়তা ও গড়িমসির পর সেই নির্বাচনটি অবশেষে অনুষ্ঠিত হতে যাচ্ছে আগামী ২৯ ডিসেম্বর ২০০৮-এ।" <br />গত দুই বছরে দেশের অর্থনীতি পিছিয়ে পড়েছে উল্লেখ করে তিনি বলেন, "একটি অনির্বাচিত সরকারের দুই বছরের শাসন দেশকে পিছিয়ে দেয় বহু বছর। মানুষকে করে ফেলে পুরোপুরি বিপন্ন। আর সেজন্যই আমাদের এবারের নির্বাচনী স্লোগান: দেশ বাঁচাও, মানুষ বাঁচাও।" <br /><br />সন্ত্রাসবাদকে বৈশ্বিক হুমকি ও বিপদ হিসেবে উল্লেখ করে খালেদা জিয়া বলেন, "ধর্মের নামে সন্ত্রাসের সৃষ্টি এবং তাকে মোকাবেলার জন্য সন্ত্রাসবিরোধী যুদ্ধের নামে এই পৃথিবীকে আরো অনিরাপদ করে তোলা হয়েছে। <br />"সন্ত্রাসের বিরুদ্ধে সবাইকে একসঙ্গে লড়তে হবে। এ ব্যাপারে আমরা খুবই সচেতন। তবে সেজন্য দক্ষিণ এশিয়ায় নতুন কোনো টাস্কফোর্স গঠন করার প্রয়োজনীয়তা নেই। কেননা এ ধরনের কোনো জোট গড়ার সঙ্গে দুর্বল রাষ্ট্রের সার্বভৌমত্বের স্পর্শকাতর প্রসঙ্গটি অনিবার্যভাবে জড়িয়ে থাকে।" <br /><br />আওয়ামী লীগের নির্বাচনী ইশতেহারে সন্ত্রাস দমনে ''দক্ষিণ এশীয় টাস্কফোর্স'' গড়ার প্রতিশ্র"তির প্রতি ইংগিত করেই বিএনপি চেয়ারপারসন এ কথা বলেন। <br /><br />যুদ্ধাপরাধীদের বিচার বা মুক্তিযোদ্ধাদের অবস্থার উন্নয়নে কোনো পদক্ষেপ নেওয়ার প্রতিশ্র"তিও তিনি এ ভাষণে দেননি। <br /><br />খালেদা জিয়ার ভাষণের আগে রাত ৮টায় আওয়ামী লীগ সভানেত্রী শেখ হাসিনার ধারণকৃত ভাষণ প্রচার করে বিটিভি। <br /><br />বিএনপি আগামী ২৯ ডিসেম্বর অনুষ্ঠেয় নবম জাতীয় সংসদ নির্বাচনে জামায়াতে ইসলামিসহ আরো কয়েকটি দল নিয়ে গঠিত চারদলীয় জোটের সঙ্গে নির্বাচন করছে। আর আওয়ামী লীগ চৌদ্দদল ও জাতীয়পার্টিসহ সমমনাদের নিয়ে গঠিত মহাজোট এর হয়ে নির্বাচনে অংশ নিচ্ছে। <br /><br

Saturday evening, promised if elected that curbing prices would be her alliance''s number one task. <br /><br />"Stern actions against corruption and terrorism, and transforming parliament into an effective institution, will also get priority," she said. <br /><br />Khaleda''s recorded speech was aired on state-owned Bangladesh Television and Radio at around 9:15pm, immediately following one by her rival Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina. <br /><br />"We made mistakes during some massive development projects, for which we are sincerely sorry and hope that you will forgive our failures and mistakes." <br /><br />"We request you to believe that we won''t repeat them as we''ve learned from the past mistakes." <br /><br />The four-party alliance chief said, "Our first task will be to quickly bring the prices down to people''s reach then to raise output by reducing production costs, if necessary, with subsidies so that people get essentials like rice, lentil, flour, edible oil at reasonable prices." <br /><br />"I today firmly promise that we''ll be tough with the corrupt and with terrorists," said the former prime minister. <br /><br />"The Dec. 29 election is very important for the country. Make ''sheaf of paddy'' a winner for protecting the country''s democracy and sovereignty," urged Khaleda. <br /><br />Khaleda''s electioneering draws to a close with her TV address with all campaigning to be concluded by midnight. <br /><br />The two former prime ministers had earlier addressed the two largest rallies of the campaign period on consecutive days, Friday and Saturday at Paltan Maidan. <br /><br />bdnews24.com/sm/mt/rah/2240hours', '2008-12-27 10:03:49', 62, 1),
