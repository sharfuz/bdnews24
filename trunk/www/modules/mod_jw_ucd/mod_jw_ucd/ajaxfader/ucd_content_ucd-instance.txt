The United Nations estimated that a million people had been left homeless, many of them in remote areas without predictable food supplies.<br /><br />Rice was distributed Monday in Patuakhali, one of the districts in Bangladesh that was badly hit Thursday by a cyclone. More Photos » <br /><br />The Bangladesh Red Crescent Society warned Sunday that the number of dead could conceivably be 5,000 to 10,000, and the United Nations World Food Program said yesterday that it would not be surprised by such a tally. But yesterday the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said that reports from its officials who had been to the hardest-hit areas led the organization to expect a final toll in line with the government’s official assessment.<br /><br />“What we are seeing on the ground is not as horrifying,” said Devendra Tak, a senior regional spokesman for the federation, who spoke from Khulna, a town in southern Bangladesh, after visiting some of the districts that took the worst pounding from the cyclone, which had winds of more than 100 miles an hour. “We don’t see the level of destruction that we had feared earlier.” <br /><br />Mr. Tak said thousands of fishermen who had been missing along the coastal areas and presumed dead had begun to turn up in their villages. “We are very optimistic that the overall disaster will not be on a very high level,” Mr. Tak said by telephone. <br /><br />The United Nations said that it was waiting for a fuller picture to emerge and that the final death toll could still be significantly higher. Usha Mishra, a senior adviser at the United Nations World Food Program, said food supplies had been severely disrupted, creating a risk of famine.<br /><br />She said the program had begun to distribute food and that more serious emergency operations were being considered, including broader food distribution and rebuilding of homes. “Shelter is the big need right now,” she said. “One million people have been turned homeless.”<br /><br />The government’s officially confirmed death toll from the cyclone reached 3,113, said Lt. Col. Main Ullah Chowdhury, a spokesman for the army, according to The Associated Press.</div>

The river swelled above the tree line. And in a flash, Mamataz Begum’s youngest child, barely 2 years old, was swept from her arms, as a tidal wave smashed through the fragile mud homes of this village and scooped up everything in its watery arms.<br /><br />Children stood amid the wreckage of their destroyed village of Khatachira on Tuesday. More Photos &gt; <br /><br />In this hamlet on the southernmost fringe of Bangladesh, cut by rivers that empty into the Bay of Bengal, nothing was spared by the cyclone that ripped through here last Thursday. Barely a single house was standing; they were all made of mud and they simply collapsed into the earth. The meager food stocks of the village had washed away. Fishing boats and nets, a principal source of income here, were gone. The paddies had filled up with brackish water, which meant there would be no harvest. <br /><br />On Tuesday, animal carcasses, stinking and bloated, lay scattered along the river bank. There was no drinking water left. A small bag of food from the government, the sole aid so far for this village of about 1,000 families, had run out. <br /><br />The people of Khatachira are a testament to the bittersweet blessings of the latest natural calamity to befall Bangladesh. Relatively speaking, the death toll from the cyclone was small — some 3,167 according to the latest official count, roughly double the death toll of Hurricane Katrina but far less than the 140,000 killed in 1991 after the last cyclone hit Bangladesh. In large measure, that was because of an early warning system that had announced the storm and had urged people to head to shelters. <br /><br />But in claiming relatively few lives, it left many more people in utter ruin. The government estimates that about four million people have been affected.<br /><br />“The crisis is just beginning,” said Suman Islam, humanitarian assistance coordinator with the aid agency Care, which had sent its first relief assessment team here Tuesday afternoon. “We have saved lives. But now, the challenge is the same.”<br /><br />In Khatachira, near the edge of the Sunderbans, the world’s largest mangrove forest, villagers have so far buried 57 of their own, nearly half of them children under age 10. Many probably died because they could not swim or cling to trees. On Tuesday morning another body, that of a local woman, was found in the bush of a neighboring village; she had yet to be brought home for burial. All but seven people had been accounted for. <br /><br />An old man who lost his entire family was searching for the bodies of his two grandchildren. Another old man said his granddaughter, age 8, was still missing. A woman with a hideous gash on her right foot — from a piece of tin roofing that fell and sliced her skin — said four in her family had been killed, and five were left to carry on. <br /><br />The nearest cyclone shelter was about two and a half miles away, and it had swelled well past capacity by the time most people in this village were ready to evacuate. One woman even went to the shelter, went home after it seemed that the storm was not coming, and was killed. <br /><br />“See over there, that was our house,” said Muhammad Himayat, pointing at an open stretch of paddy. The house is gone, along with two dozen goats, two cows and three fishing boats that together were the family’s livelihood. “It is all river now.”<br /><br />This is what the villagers said among themselves:<br /><br />“Where’s Salem?” one man asked.<br /><br />“He lost his son,” someone responded.<br /><br />“Has the grandson been found?”<br /><br />“No.”<br /><br />Scientists studying climate change in this part of the world say they expect extreme weather, including cyclones and powerful tropical storms, to rise in frequency here. And the United Nations has increasingly warned of the high toll these disasters exact on the poor.<br /><br />The survivors of Cyclone Sidr are among the poorest of the poorest, in one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world. <br /><br />Dysentery was the next demon that aid workers were guarding against. In this watery land, clean drinking water is in short supply. There are only a few water wells. The ponds, from which many villagers get their drinking water, are contaminated with rotting leaves and animals. Toilets are rare, and the practice of defecating in the fields makes it much easier for disease to spread. <br /><br />The government has appealed for international aid and in a rare gesture, opened its visa gates to foreigners, including journalists. Officials said relief workers and the military had reached the last remaining pockets of the devastated areas on Tuesday, Reuters reported.<br /><br />But food supplies remained woefully inadequate. “Hundreds of hands go up to grab just one food packet,” said a relief worker in the Patuakhali district.<br /><br />Donor countries have pledged $142 million in emergency aid. The United Nations World Food Program has distributed nearly 100 tons of high-energy biscuits and was to begin delivering rice on Friday. The United States has offered two C-130 transport planes and two amphibious naval vessels with helicopters. <br /><br />But delivering aid to places like Khatachira is not easy. Getting here means a long drive, crossing a narrow river whose only ferry has been destroyed, driving through a fetid market town that smells of dead flesh and taking a two-hour boat ride along the Baleshwar River, afloat with dead goats and ducks. <br /><br />Along the journey, one can see evidence of life limping back. A village government office, relatively untouched, has placed its documents on the front porch to dry. A remote college had its roof and walls blown off, but someone has neatly arranged the desks. The roads had been cleared of fallen logs. Banana trees and palms lay crumpled, like victims of an all-night brawl. <br /><br />The day after the cyclone, villagers here had hoisted red flags at the edge of the hamlet. Aid workers had been slow to arrive but those who had were besieged by villagers, who knew that only in narrating their losses could they expect to gain anything. <br /><br />On the edge of the water, near a tree whose roots were barely hanging onto the earth, stood a couple of cooking pots — remnants of Mamataz Begum’s kitchen. Her son’s body had washed up in another village, and they brought his corpse here. Her other children survived. Her husband broke his leg as he swam through the waves. <br /><br />On Tuesday, she was still dazed, and had no idea where the family’s next meal would come from. <br /><br />“If God will feed us, we will eat,” she said.</div>

<div class="ucd_introtext"><!--IMAGE images/stories/breaking_news/200804/spared-cyclones-worst-area-still-suffers.jpg IMAGE--> <img class="content-left" src="images/stories/breaking_news/200804/spared-cyclones-worst-area-still-suffers.jpg" border="0" align="left" />KANAINAGAR, Bangladesh, Nov. 21 — To the naked eye, this looks like a village that Cyclone Sidr barely grazed. Most of the houses are standing. No one has died. The trees are not even decapitated, as they are in so many hamlets swallowed by the storm.<br /><br />Women hung onto one another as they stood in line for food aid. Millions of Bangladeshis are in dire need of clean water, food and shelter after the cyclone. <br /><br />But in this part of the world, where life revolves around water, look more closely and see how the storm has fouled so much of everyday life. Rice fields are waterlogged. Shrimp ponds have rotted. Women worry what their children will drink once their pots of rainwater run out. Not enough water, too much water, dirty water. Water bedevils everyone.<br /><br />Aid began to trickle in across the cyclone zone on Wednesday, nearly a week after the storm. In this village, a long line of supplicants received sacks of rice, lentils and salt, and the country’s neighbors, allies and rivals seemed to fall over themselves to offer charity and succor.<br /><br />Pakistan, the country’s former ruler, which Bangladesh fought a bitter war of independence against in 1971, announced that it would send two military planes full of medical supplies and blankets. India said that an air force cargo plane would arrive Thursday with 38 tons of aid.<br /><br />Two United States Navy vessels were en route and expected to arrive with helicopters within days. Saudi Arabia pledged $100 million early this week, the largest amount, until the World Bank offered $250 million on Wednesday. Whether and how soon the pledged support will materialize is a mystery.<br /><br />Neither the government nor aid agencies had an estimate on how much money was necessary to meet the humanitarian need, but a World Food Program assessment found that $30 million would be required for food just for the next three months. The United Nations resident representative for Bangladesh, Renata Lok Dessalien, said food, water and shelter were the immediate needs, and were all the more acute for cyclone victims who were already poor, likely to be malnourished and vulnerable to disease.<br /><br />Cyclone Sidr cut a wide and debilitating swath through southern Bangladesh. The government estimates that four million people have been affected, and the full scope of its impact may not be felt for many weeks. By the Bangladeshi Army’s latest count, 3,167 people have died.<br /><br />In Kanainagar, near Dhaka, the capital, Sunita Mondol, 15, was feeling the cyclone’s toll. She stood at the side of her family’s pond Wednesday morning and found no more than two tiny shrimps clinging to her net. On a normal morning, she would haul in a full basket and take it to the market to sell. <br /><br />But the storm had spoiled the pond, shaking the leaves and branches from the trees and fouling the water, so much that the shrimps died and floated belly up. On the first morning after the storm, Sunita and her family pulled up more than 13 pounds of dead fish. They threw most away.<br /><br />Families like hers, who make their living from selling the fish and shrimps they cultivate in their ponds, expect to feel the economic pinch of the cyclone for months. Every family in this village has a small pond, and family after family complained of theirs having been fouled.<br /><br />Half of the fish in Pinjira Begum’s two big ponds floated belly up, which meant that her daily earnings plummeted by nearly half. The moneylender came to her home last Saturday for his weekly payment. “We told him we didn’t have money to buy rice for the children,” she said. She gave him half of what she owed. He cursed her and left.<br /><br />Southern Bangladesh is one of the world’s most productive shrimp hubs. Shrimp is one of the country’s largest exports to the United States.<br /><br />The lucky ones here had rainwater left in their traditional earthen pots. Those whose water had run out, or whose pots had broken, had to drink the pond water, which had turned salty from seawater and had begun to stink from putrefying leaves.<br /><br />A rickshaw puller down the road wondered aloud how long it would be until dysentery struck. Even without a cyclone, he said, water brings a constant specter of disease. <br /><br />In the hot months, when the rainwater stores run out and the ponds start drying up, the people of Kanainagar suffer rashes, dysentery and diarrhea. The cyclone made a chronic concern potentially acute. <br /><br />“Water is our main problem,” said Alamgir Hossain. “People get too sick to work, and still they have to buy medicine.”<br /><br />Across the Mongla River, Muhammad Nantu Mian worked feverishly to salvage what the water had not wrecked. His rice field was flooded, just two weeks before the harvest was due. The stalks were blown down like scarecrows by the brute wind. He had drained some of the water by cutting channels in his fields. He hired workers to cut what rice stalks had not yet rotted. He figured a third of his crop was gone.<br /><br />Normally, Mr. Mian said, he sold half of what he produced, saving the rest for his own family and for next year’s seeds. This year, he said, he could reasonably hope to be able to feed his family, and not much more.</div>
